{"title": "Pride and Prejudice", "author": "Jane Austen", "content": "Pride and Prejudice\n\nBy Jane Austen\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 1.\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in\n\npossession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man\n\nmay be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so\n\nwell fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is  considered the rightful property of some one or other of their  daughters.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have\n\nyou heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\"\n\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\n\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here,\n\nand she told me all about it.\"\n \nMr. Bennet made no answer.\n \n\"Do you not want to know who has taken it?\" cried his\n\nwife impatiently.\n\n\"  You  want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing\n\nit.\"\n \nThis was invitation enough.\n\n\n\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that\n\nNetherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the\n\nnorth of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise\n\nand four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it,  that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take  possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to\n\nbe in the house by the end of next week.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n \n\"Bingley.\"\n\n\"Is he married or single?\"\n\n\"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large\n\nfortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our\n\ngirls!\"\n\n\"How so? How can it affect them?\"\n \n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be\n\nso tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his\n\nmarrying one of them.\"\n\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very\n\nlikely that he MAY fall in love with one of them, and\n\ntherefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or\n\nyou may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\n\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr.\n\nBingley may like you the best of the party.\"\n\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly HAVE had my share\n\nof beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary\n\nnow. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought\n\nto give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\n\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to\n\nthink of.\"\n \n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley\n\nwhen he comes into the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an\n\nestablishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and\n\nLady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do\n\nnot.\"\n \n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley  will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by  you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying\n\n\n\nwhichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a\n\ngood word for my little Lizzy.\"\n\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\n\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\n\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving  her  the preference.\"\n\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\"\n\nreplied he; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but\n\nLizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bennet, how  can  you abuse your own children in\n\nsuch a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no\n\ncompassion for my poor nerves.\"\n\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your\n\nnerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention\n\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\n\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife\n\nunderstand his character.  Her  mind was less difficult to\n\ndevelop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little  information, and uncertain temper. When she was\n\ndiscontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her\n\nlife was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting\n\nand news.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.\n\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on  Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till\n\nthe evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of\n\nit. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing  his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\n\naddressed her with:\n \n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\n\n\"We are not in a way to know  what  Mr. Bingley likes,\"\n\nsaid her mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\n\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall\n\nmeet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to\n\nintroduce him.\"\n \n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She\n\nhas two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical\n\nwoman, and I have no opinion of her.\"\n\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find\n\nthat you do not depend on her serving you.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\n\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\n\n\n\"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a\n\nlittle compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\n\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father;\n\n\"she times them ill.\"\n \n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty\n\nfretfully. \"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\n\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\n\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not\n\ncome back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her\n\nto introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\n \n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your\n\nfriend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to  her .\"\n \n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not\n\nacquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\n\n\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance\n\nis certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is  by the end of a fortnight. But if  we  do not venture somebody  else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must\n\nstand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of\n\nkindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\n\n\n\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\n \n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\"\n\ncried he. \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the  stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree  with you  there . What say you, Mary? For you are a young\n\nlady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and\n\nmake extracts.\"\n \nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\n\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us\n\nreturn to Mr. Bingley.\"\n\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear  that ; but why did not you tell me that\n\nbefore? If I had known as much this morning I certainly\n\nwould not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have\n\nactually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance\n\nnow.\"\n \nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished;\n\nthat of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when\n\nthe first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it\n\nwas what she had expected all the while.\n\n\n\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew\n\nI should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls\n\ntoo well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I\n\nam! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone\n\nthis morning and never said a word about it till now.\"\n\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said\n\nMr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with\n\nthe raptures of his wife.\n\n\"What an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when\n\nthe door was shut. \"I do not know how you will ever make\n\nhim amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At\n\nour time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be  making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we  would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you  are  the\n\nyoungest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the\n\nnext ball.\"\n \n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I  am\n\nthe youngest, I'm the tallest.\"\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how\n\nsoon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining\n\nwhen they should ask him to dinner.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.\n\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of\n\nher five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to  draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr.\n\nBingley. They attacked him in various ways--with barefaced\n\nquestions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he  eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to  accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady\n\nLucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had\n\nbeen delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully  handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he  meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing\n\ncould be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain\n\nstep towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr.\n\nBingley's heart were entertained.\n\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\n\nNetherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the\n\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\n\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had\n\nentertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young\n\nladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only  the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they  had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that\n\nhe wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\n\n\n\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to\n\ndo credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\n\ndeferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the  following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour  of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\n\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\n\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear  that he might be always flying about from one place to  another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.\n\nLady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his\n\nbeing gone to London only to get a large party for the ball;  and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring  twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\n\nThe girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were\n\ncomforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of  twelve he brought only six with him from London--his five  sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly\n\nroom it consisted of only five altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two\n\nsisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\n\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His\n\nsisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His\n\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but  his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by  his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\n\nreport which was in general circulation within five minutes\n\n\n\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The  gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the\n\nladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley,\n\nand he was looked at with great admiration for about half the  evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide  of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be\n\nabove his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\n\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a  most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being  unworthy to be compared with his friend.\n\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\n\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,  danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,  and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\n\nqualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between\n\nhim and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.  Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced  to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking\n\nabout the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own\n\nparty. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most  disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he  would never come there again. Amongst the most violent\n\nagainst him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general\n\nbehaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\n\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentle men, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that\n\ntime, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear\n\na conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from\n\nthe dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\n\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to\n\nsee you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You\n\nhad much better dance.\"\n \n\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I\n\nam particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an\n\nassembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are\n\nengaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it\n\nwould not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\"\n\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr.\n\nBingley, \"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with\n\nso many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and\n\nthere are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\n\n\"  You  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the\n\nroom,\" said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But\n\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is  very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my\n\npartner to introduce you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a\n\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his\n\nown and coldly said: \"She is tolerable, but not handsome\n\nenough to tempt  me ; I am in no humour at present to give  consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for\n\nyou are wasting your time with me.\"\n\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her\n\nfriends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which\n\ndelighted in anything ridiculous.\n\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\n\nadmired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced\n\nwith her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,  though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary\n\nhad heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\n\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and  Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners,  which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.\n\nThey returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the\n\nvillage where they lived, and of which they were the principal  inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he  was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\n\n\n\ngood deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which  had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped\n\nthat his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed;\n\nbut he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.\n\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we\n\nhave had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I\n\nwish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could\n\nbe like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr.  Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her  twice! Only think of  that , my dear; he actually danced with\n\nher twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he\n\nasked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was\n\nso vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did  not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he\n\nseemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the\n\ndance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\n\nasked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with\n\nMiss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two\n\nfifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\n\nboulanger --\"\n \n\"If he had had any compassion for  me  ,\" cried her husband\n\nimpatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much! For\n\nGod's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had\n\nsprained his ankle in the first place!\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so\n\nexcessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I\n\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.\n\nI dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown--\"\n\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to\n\nseek another branch of the subject, and related, with much\n\nbitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking\n\nrudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not\n\nlose much by not suiting  his  fancy; for he is a most\n\ndisagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high  and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked  here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not\n\nhandsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there,\n\nmy dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite\n\ndetest the man.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 4.\n\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had\n\nbeen cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed\n\nto her sister just how very much she admired him.\n\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she,\n\n\"sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy\n\nman-ners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\n\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young\n\nman ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\n\nthereby complete.\"\n\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a\n\nsecond time. I did not expect such a compliment.\"\n\n\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great\n\ndifference between us. Compliments always take  you  by  surprise, and  me  never. What could be more natural than his  asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were\n\nabout five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.\n\nNo thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.\"\n\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people\n\nin general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are\n\ngood and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill\n\nof a human being in your life.\"\n\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I\n\nalways speak what I think.\"\n\n\"I know you do; and it is  that  which makes the wonder.\n\nWith  your  good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies\n\nand nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common\n\nenough--one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid\n\nwithout ostentation or design--to take the good of everybody's\n\ncharacter and make it still better, and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too,  do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\n\n\"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women\n\nwhen you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with  her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if  we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\n\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\n\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in  general; and with more quickness of observation and less  pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too\n\nunassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little\n\ndisposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies;  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in\n\n\n\nthe power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it,  but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had\n\nbeen educated in one of the first private seminaries in town,\n\nhad a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of  spending more than they ought, and of associating with  people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to\n\nthink well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of\n\na respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance  more deeply impressed on their memories than that their  brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\n\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\n\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended  to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley\n\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his\n\ncounty; but as he was now provided with a good house and\n\nthe liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who  best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not  spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the\n\nnext generation to purchase.\n\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant,  Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his\n\ntable--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more\n\nfashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as  her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age  two years, when he was tempted by an accidental\n\n\n\nrecommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at\n\nit, and into it for half-an hour--was pleased with the situation\n\nand the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in\n\nits praise, and took it immediately.\n\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley\n\nwas endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and\n\nductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a  greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never  appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard,\n\nBingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the\n\nhighest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He  was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and\n\nhis manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that\n\nrespect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure  of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually  giving offense.\n\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly\n\nwas sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with  more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody\n\nhad been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no\n\nformality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the\n\nroom; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel  more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection  of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\n\n\n\nnone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none\n\nreceived either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he\n\nacknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.\n\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\n\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and\n\ntheir brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of\n\nher as he chose.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 5.\n\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William  Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had\n\nmade a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of\n\nknighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had  given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a\n\nsmall market town; and, in quitting them both, he had\n\nremoved with his family to a house about a mile from  Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where  he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\n\nunshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil\n\nto all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not  render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention  to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging,\n\nhis presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.\n\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent\n\nyoung woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate\n\nfriend.\n \nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet\n\nto talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning\n\nafter the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear\n\nand to communicate.\n\n\n\n\"  You  began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet\n\nwith civil self-command to Miss Lucas. \"  You  were Mr.\n\nBingley's first choice.\"\n\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\n \n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with\n\nher twice. To be sure that  did  seem as if he admired her-\n\nindeed I rather believe he  did --I heard something about it-but I\n\nhardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\n\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking\n\nhim how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did\n\nnot think there were a great many pretty women in the room,\n\nand  which  he thought the prettiest? and his answering  immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\n\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'\"\n\n\"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that\n\ndoes seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you\n\nknow.\"\n \n\" My  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours\n\n,\n\nEliza,\" said Charlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just\n\ntolerable .\"\n\n\n\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed\n\nby his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\n\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long\n\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\n\nwithout once opening his lips.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?\"\n\nsaid Jane. \"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\n\n\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked  Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said  he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.\"\n\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks\n\nmuch, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With  them  he\n\nis remarkably agreeable.\"\n\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so\n\nvery agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can\n\nguess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride,  and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not  keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\n\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss\n\nLucas, \"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\n \n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance\n\nwith  him , if I were you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you  never  to dance\n\nwith him.\"\n \n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend  me  so much\n\nas pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One  cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family,  fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of\n\nhimself. If I may so express it, he has a  right  to be proud.\"\n\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily\n\nforgive  his  pride, if he had not mortified  mine .\"\n \n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the\n\nsolidity of her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I\n\nbelieve. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is  very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone  to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a\n\nfeeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or\n\nother, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things,  though the words are often used synonymously. A person may  be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion\n\nof ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of\n\nus.\"\n \n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who\n\ncame with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I\n\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\n\nday.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\"\n\nsaid Mrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take\n\naway your bottle directly.\"\n\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the\n\nvisit.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 6.\n\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of\n\nNetherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss\n\nBennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs.\n\nHurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to\n\nbe intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a  wish of being better acquainted with THEM was expressed  towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received\n\nwith the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw\n\nsuperciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly  excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though  their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\n\nall probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.\n\nIt was generally evident whenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain\n\nfor him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in\n\nlove; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to  be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with  great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\n\nuniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from\n\nthe suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her\n\nfriend Miss Lucas.\n \n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able\n\nto impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\n\ndisadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her\n\n\n\naffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may  lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\n\nconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is\n\nso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment,  that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all BEGIN  freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\n\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love\n\nwithout encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had  better show MORE affection than she feels. Bingley likes  your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like\n\nher, if she does not help him on.\"\n\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will  allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a  simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.\"\n\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's\n\ndisposition as you do.\"\n\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not\n\nendeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.\"\n \n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though\n\nBingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be\n\nemployed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make\n\nthe most of every half-hour in which she can command his\n\n\n\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more\n\nleisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\n\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where noth\n\ning is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I  were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare  say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is\n\nnot acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\n\ndegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has  known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him  at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and\n\nhas since dined with him in company four times. This is not\n\nquite enough to make her understand his character.\"\n\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him,\n\nshe might only have discovered whether he had a good\n\nappetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also\n\nbeen spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\n\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain\n\nthat they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with\n\nrespect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine\n\nthat much has been unfolded.\"\n \n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my\n\nheart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should\n\nthink she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to\n\nbe studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in  marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of\n\n\n\nthe parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so  similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\n\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike\n\nafterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to\n\nknow as little as possible of the defects of the person with\n\nwhom you are to pass your life.\"\n\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You\n\nknow it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way\n\nyourself.\"\n\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her\n\nsister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself\n\nbecoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.  Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he\n\nhad looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when\n\nthey next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner\n\nhad he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly  had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was  rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression\n\nof her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others\n\nequally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye  more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was  forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and\n\nin spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the\n\nfashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man\n\n\n\nwho made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not\n\nthought her handsome enough to dance with.\n\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step\n\ntowards conversing with her himself, attended to her  conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was  at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.\n\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by\n\nlistening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\n\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\n\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know\n\nthat I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I\n\ndo not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow\n\nafraid of him.\"\n \nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without\n\nseeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied\n\nher friend to mention such a subject to him; which  immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him\n\nand said:\n \n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself\n\nuncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel\n\nForster to give us a ball at Meryton?\"\n\n\n\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes\n\na lady energetic.\"\n\n\"You are severe on us.\"\n \n\"It will be HER turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas.\n\n\"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what\n\nfollows.\"\n \n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--\n\nalways wanting me to play and sing before anybody and  everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would  have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit\n\ndown before those who must be in the habit of hearing the\n\nvery best performers.\" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,  she added, \"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely  glancing at Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which\n\neverybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath\n\nto cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my\n\nsong.\"\n\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means\n\ncapital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the\n\nentreaties of several that she would sing again, she was  eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who  having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the\n\nfamily, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments,\n\nwas always impatient for display.\n\n\n\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air\n\nand conceited manner, which would have injured a higher\n\ndegree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy  and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure,  though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a\n\nlong concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\n\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters,\n\nwho, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers,\n\njoined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.\n\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a\n\nmode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all  conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to  perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir\n\nWilliam thus began:\n\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is,  Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider  it as one of the first refinements of polished society.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in\n\nvogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every\n\nsavage can dance.\"\n\nSir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs\n\ndelightfully,\" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley\n\njoin the group; \"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the\n\nscience yourself, Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\n\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure\n\nfrom the sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?\"\n\n\"Never, sir.\"\n \n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the\n\nplace?\"\n\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can\n\navoid it.\"\n \n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\n \nMr. Darcy bowed.\n\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-for\n\nI am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\n\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was\n\nnot disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant\n\nmoving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing\n\na very gallant thing, and called out to her:\n\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr.\n\nDarcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as\n\na very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am\n\n\n\nsure when so much beauty is before you.\" And, taking her  hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though\n\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she\n\ninstantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir\n\nWilliam:\n \n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I\n\nentreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to\n\nbeg for a partner.\"\n\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed\n\nthe honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined;\n\nnor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\n\npersuasion.\n\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is\n\ncruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this\n\ngentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no\n\nobjection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\n\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\n\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear\n\nMiss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who\n\nwould object to such a partner?\"\n\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking\n\n\n\nof her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss\n\nBingley:\n\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\n\n\"I should imagine not.\"\n\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to\n\npass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and\n\nindeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed!\n\nThe insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!\"\n\n\"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind\n\nwas more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the  very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a  pretty woman can bestow.\"\n\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and\n\ndesired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring\n\nsuch reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\n\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\n \n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley. \"I am all\n\nastonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?--and\n\npray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\n\n\n\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.\n\nA lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration\n\nto love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you\n\nwould be wishing me joy.\"\n\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter\n\nis absolutely settled. You will be having a charming motherin-\n\nlaw, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley\n\nwith you.\"\n\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she\n\nchose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his\n\ncomposure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed\n\nlong.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 7.\n\nMr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant\n\nrelation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her\n\nsituation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her  father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four  thousand pounds.\n\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a\n\nclerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a\n\nbrother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\n\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from\n\nMeryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies,\n\nwho were usually tempted thither three or four times a week,  to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over  the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and\n\nLydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their\n\nminds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing  better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse  their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening;\n\nand however bare of news the country in general might be,\n\nthey always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At  present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and  happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\n\nneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and\n\nMeryton was the headquarters.\n\n\n\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to\n\ntheir knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their\n\nlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to  know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all,  and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown\n\nbefore. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\n\nBingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.\n\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this\n\nsubject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed:\n\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you\n\nmust be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have\n\nsuspected it some time, but I am now convinced.\"\n\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but\n\nLydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in\n\nthe course of the day, as he was going the next morning to\n\nLondon.\n \n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you\n\nshould be so ready to think your own children silly. If I\n\nwished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should\n\nnot be of my own, however.\"\n\n\n\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible\n\nof it.\"\n \n\"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\n\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not  agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every  particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\n\nyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to  have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to  our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more\n\nthan we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat\n\nmyself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if  a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,  should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I\n\nthought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night\n\nat Sir William's in his regimentals.\"\n\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster\n\nand Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as\n\nthey did when they first came; she sees them now very often\n\nstanding in Clarke's library.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the\n\nfootman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from\n\nNetherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs.\n\n\n\nBennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\n\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does\n\nhe say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my\n\nlove.\"\n \n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\n\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,-\n\n\"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with  Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for  the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two\n\nwomen can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you\n\ncan on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to\n\ndine with the officers.--Yours ever,\n \n\"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\n \n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia. \"I wonder my aunt did\n\nnot tell us of THAT.\"\n \n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\n\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\n\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it\n\nseems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\n\n\n\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you\n\nwere sure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\n\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to\n\ngo to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\n\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am\n\nsure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\"\n\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get\n\nthem.\"\n \n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my\n\nmother's purpose will be answered.\"\n\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go\n\non horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with\n\nmany cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were\n\nanswered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\n\nJane certainly could not come back.\n\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet  more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her  own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all\n\n\n\nthe felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over  when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note\n\nfor Elizabeth:\n \n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,-\n \n\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose,  is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My\n\nkind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\n\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not\n\nmuch the matter with me.--Yours, etc.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had  read the note aloud, \"if your daughter should have a  dangerous fit of illness--if she should die, it would be a\n\ncomfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and\n\nunder your orders.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of\n\nlittle trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as\n\nshe stays there, it is all very well. I would go an see her if I\n\ncould have the carriage.\"\n\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\n\nhorsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared\n\nher resolution.\n\n\n\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of\n\nsuch a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen\n\nwhen you get there.\"\n\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\n\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for\n\nthe horses?\"\n \n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance\n\nis nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be\n\nback by dinner.\"\n\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed\n\nMary, \"but every impulse of feeling should be guided by\n\nreason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in\n\nproportion to what is required.\"\n\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine\n\nand Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three\n\nyoung ladies set off together.\n\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along,\n\n\"perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he\n\ngoes.\"\n\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jump\n\n\n\ning over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient  activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house,\n\nwith weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with\n\nthe warmth of exercise.\n \nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but\n\nJane were assembled, and where her appearance created a\n\ngreat deal of surprise. That she should have walked three\n\nmiles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by\n\nherself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss\n\nBingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in\n\ncontempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by\n\nthem; and in their brother's manners there was something  better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.  Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The\n\nformer was divided between admiration of the brilliancy\n\nwhich exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to  the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter  was thinking only of his breakfast.\n\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably\n\nanswered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very  feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth  was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had\n\nonly been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or\n\ninconvenience from expressing in her note how much she  longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was  not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss\n\n\n\nBingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she\n\nwas treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\n\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The\n\napothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as\n\nmight be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and  that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to  return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\n\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased,\n\nand her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room\n\nfor a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the\n\ngentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do\n\nelsewhere.\n \nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must\n\ngo, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the  carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it,\n\nwhen Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss\n\nBingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\n\nLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back\n\na supply of clothes.\n\n\n\nChapter 8.\n\nAt five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-\n\npast six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil  inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had\n\nthe pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of\n\nMr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved,\n\nhow shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively\n\nthey disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more\n\nof the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not\n\nimmediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment\n\nof all her former dislike.\n \nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and\n\nthey prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she\n\nbelieved she was considered by the others. She had very little  notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.  Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by\n\nwhom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only\n\nto eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to\n\nprefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and\n\nMiss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the\n\nroom. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a\n\n\n\nmixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation,\n\nno style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\n\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\n\nexcellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this\n\nmorning. She really looked almost wild.\"\n\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my\n\ncountenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must SHE\n\nbe scampering about the country, because her sister had a\n\ncold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\"\n\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six\n\ninches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown\n\nwhich had been let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\n\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley;\n\n\"but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth\n\nBennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room\n\nthis morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\n\n\"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss\n\nBingley; \"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish\n\nto see YOUR sister make such an exhibition.\"\n \n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or\n\nwhatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!\n\n\n\nWhat could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-\n\ntown indifference to decorum.\"\n \n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\"\n\nsaid Bingley.\n\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half\n\nwhisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your\n\nadmiration of her fine eyes.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the\n\nexercise.\" A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst\n\nbegan again:\n\n\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is\n\nreally a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were\n\nwell settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low\n\nconnections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\n\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney\n\non Meryton.\"\n\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near\n\nCheapside.\"\n\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed\n\nheartily.\n\n\n\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\" cried\n\nBingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\n\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of\n\nmarrying men of any consideration in the world,\" replied\n\nDarcy.\n\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters\n\ngave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some\n\ntime at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.\n\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till\n\nsummoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth\n\nwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had  the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her  rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs\n\nherself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\n\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but  suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and  making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for\n\nthe short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst\n\nlooked at her with astonishment.\n \n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather\n\nsingular.\"\n\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards.\n\nShe is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\n\n\n\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried\n\nElizabeth; \"I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in\n\nmany things.\"\n\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said  Bingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her  quite well.\"\n\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked\n\ntowards the table where a few books were lying. He  immediately offered to fetch her others--all that his library\n\nafforded.\n \n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and\n\nmy own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not\n\nmany, I have more than I ever looked into.\"\n\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly\n\nwith those in the room.\n \n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father\n\nshould have left so small a collection of books. What a\n\ndelightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\n\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of\n\nmany generations.\"\n\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are\n\nalways buying books.\"\n\n\n\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in\n\nsuch days as these.\"\n\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\n\nbeauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build YOUR\n\nhouse, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\n\n\"I wish it may.\"\n\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in\n\nthat neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.\n\nThere is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\n\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy\n\nwill sell it.\"\n \n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible\n\nto get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\n\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to\n\nleave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it  wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed  herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe\n\nthe game.\n\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss\n\nBingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\n\n\n\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's\n\nheight, or rather taller.\"\n\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody\n\nwho delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such  manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her  performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\n\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can\n\nhave patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\n\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do\n\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover\n\nscreens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot  do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of  for the first time, without being informed that she was very\n\naccomplished.\"\n\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said  Darcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a  woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse\n\nor covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with\n\nyou in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of  knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my  acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\n\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\n\n\n\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great\n\ndeal in your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be  really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass  what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough\n\nknowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the\n\nmodern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this,  she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of  walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or\n\nthe word will be but half-deserved.\"\n \n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this  she must yet add something more substantial, in the  improvement of her mind by extensive reading.\"\n\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six\n\naccomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing\n\nANY.\"\n \n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the\n\npossibility of all this?\"\n\n\"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and\n\ntaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that\n\nthey knew many women who answered this description, when\n\nMr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\n\nroom.\n \n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was  closed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to  recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their\n\nown; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my\n\nopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was\n\nchiefly addressed, \"there is a meanness in ALL the arts which\n\nladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.\n\nWhatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\n\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply\n\nas to continue the subject.\n\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\n\nworse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr.  Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced  that no country advice could be of any service, recommended\n\nan express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.\n\nThis she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that\n\n\n\nMr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss  Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite\n\nuncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.\n\nThey solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention\n\nmight be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 9.\n\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received\n\nfrom Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards\n\nfrom the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite  of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent  to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\n\nown judgement of her situation. The note was immediately\n\ndispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs.  Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached  Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet\n\nwould have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing  her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her  recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would\n\nprobably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen,\n\ntherefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home;  neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time,  think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane,\n\non Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and\n\nthree daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found  Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal\n\ntoo ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of\n\n\n\nmoving her. We must trespass a little longer on your\n\nkindness.\"\n \n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My\n\nsister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\n \n\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley,\n\nwith cold civility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every\n\npossible attention while she remains with us.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends\n\nI do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill\n\nindeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest\n\npatience in the world, which is always the way with her, for  she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever  met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to HER.\n\nYou have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming\n\nprospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the  country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of  quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short\n\nlease.\"\n \n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and  therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should  probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I\n\nconsider myself as quite fixed here.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said\n\nElizabeth.\n \n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning\n\ntowards her.\n \n\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\"\n\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so\n\neasily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\n\n\"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep,\n\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as\n\nyours.\"\n\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and\n\ndo not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at\n\nhome.\"\n \n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately,\n\n\"that your were a studier of character. It must be an amusing\n\nstudy.\"\n\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing. They\n\nhave at least that advantage.\"\n\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a\n\nfew subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you\n\nmove in a very confined and unvarying society.\"\n\n\n\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is\n\nsomething new to be observed in them for ever.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner\n\nof mentioning a country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is\n\nquite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\"\n\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her\n\nfor a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied\n\nshe had gained a complete victory over him, continued her\n\ntriumph.\n\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\n\ncountry, for my part, except the shops and public places. The\n\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\n\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to\n\nleave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.\n\nThey have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy\n\nin either.\"\n \n\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But\n\nthat gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the\n\ncountry was nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth,  blushing for her mother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He  only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be\n\n\n\nmet with in the country as in the town, which you must\n\nacknowledge to be true.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\n\nmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe  there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with  four and-twenty families.\"\n\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to\n\nkeep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and  directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive  smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might\n\nturn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas\n\nhad been at Longbourn since HER coming away.\n\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an\n\nagreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So\n\nmuch the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He had always\n\nsomething to say to everybody. THAT is my idea of good  breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very  important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the\n\nmatter.\"\n \n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\n\n\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the\n\nmince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants\n\nthat can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up\n\nvery differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves,\n\n\n\nand the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is  a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so\n\nVERY plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\n\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\n\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady\n\nLucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I\n\ndo not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one\n\ndoes not often see anybody better looking. It is what  everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she  was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in\n\ntown so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure\n\nhe would make her an offer before we came away. But,  however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they\n\nwere.\"\n \n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently.  \"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same  way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in\n\ndriving away love!\"\n\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of\n\nlove,\" said Darcy.\n\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes\n\nwhat is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\n\n\n\ninclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\n\nentirely away.\"\n\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued\n\nmade Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing  herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing  to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating\n\nher thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an\n\napology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was  unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister  to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She\n\nperformed her part indeed without much graciousness, but\n\nMrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her\n\ncarriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put  herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each\n\nother during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\n\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his\n\nfirst coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\n\ncomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite\n\nwith her mother, whose affection had brought her into public  at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of  natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers,\n\nto whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners\n\nrecommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very  equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the  ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it\n\n\n\nwould be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not  keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to\n\ntheir mother's ear:\n \n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my  engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if  you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not\n\nwish to be dancing when she is ill.\"\n\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when\n\nyou have given YOUR ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their\n\ngiving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a\n\nshame if he does not.\"\n \nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and\n\nElizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her\n\nrelations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr.\n\nDarcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley's\n\nwitticisms on FINE EYES.\n\n\n\nChapter 10.\n\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs.  Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and\n\nin the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-\n\nroom. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was  writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the  progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention\n\nby messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at\n\npiquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\n\ncompanion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either\n\non his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the  length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her  praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\n\nexactly in union with her opinion of each.\n\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a\n\nletter!\"\n \nHe made no answer.\n \n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\n\n\n\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\n\ncourse of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I\n\nshould think them!\"\n \n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of\n\nyours.\"\n\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\n\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for\n\nyou. I mend pens remarkably well.\"\n\n\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\n\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n \n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement\n\non the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures\n\nwith her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it\n\ninfinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.\"\n\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write\n\nagain? At present I have not room to do them justice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But\n\ndo you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.\n\nDarcy?\"\n\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it\n\nis not for me to determine.\"\n \n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long\n\nletter with ease, cannot write ill.\"\n\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\"\n\ncried her brother, \"because he does NOT write with ease. He\n\nstudies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you,\n\nDarcy?\"\n\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most\n\ncareless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and\n\nblots the rest.\"\n \n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express  them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas  at all to my correspondents.\"\n\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must\n\ndisarm reproof.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the\n\nappearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of\n\nopinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.\"\n\n\"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece\n\nof modesty?\"\n\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your\n\ndefects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding\n\nfrom a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution,  which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized\n\nmuch by the possessor, and often without any attention to the\n\nimperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet  this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting  Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it\n\nto be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet\n\nwhat is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must  leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real  advantage to yourself or anyone else?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at\n\nnight all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And  yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be\n\ntrue, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did\n\nnot assume the character of needless precipitance merely to\n\nshow off before the ladies.\"\n\n\n\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means\n\nconvinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your\n\nconduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any\n\nman I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend  were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you  would probably do it, you would probably not go--and at\n\nanother word, might stay a month.\"\n\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\n\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have\n\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\n \n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your\n\nconverting what my friend says into a compliment on the  sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a  turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he\n\nwould certainly think better of me, if under such a\n\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as\n\nI could.\"\n \n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your\n\noriginal intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering\n\nto it?\"\n \n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter;\n\nDarcy must speak for himself.\"\n\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose\n\nto call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing\n\n\n\nthe case, however, to stand according to your representation,  you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is\n\nsupposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his\n\nplan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one\n\nargument in favour of its propriety.\"\n\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the PERSUASION of a friend\n\nis no merit with you.\"\n\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\n\nunderstanding of either.\"\n\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\n\ninfluence of friendship and affection. A regard for the\n\nrequester would often make one readily yield to a request,  without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not  particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed\n\nabout Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\n\ncircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his\n\nbehaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases  between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the\n\nother to change a resolution of no very great moment, should\n\nyou think ill of that person for complying with the desire,\n\nwithout waiting to be argued into it?\"\n\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this\n\nsubject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of\n\nimportance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the\n\ndegree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\n\n\n\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the\n\nparticulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size;\n\nfor that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet,\n\nthan you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not  such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should  not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a\n\nmore awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\n\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday\n\nevening, when he has nothing to do.\"\n\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could\n\nperceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked\n\nher laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had  received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such\n\nnonsense.\n \n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend. \"You dislike\n\nan argument, and want to silence this.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If\n\nyou and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the\n\nroom, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever\n\nyou like of me.\"\n\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my\n\nside; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\n\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n\n\n\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley\n\nmoved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite\n\nrequest that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as\n\npolitely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\n\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\n\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\n\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how  frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly  knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\n\nadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at\n\nher because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could  only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice  because there was something more wrong and reprehensible,\n\naccording to his ideas of right, than in any other person\n\npresent. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too\n\nlittle to care for his approbation.\n\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the\n\ncharm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy,\n\ndrawing near Elizabeth, said to her:\n\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize\n\nsuch an opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\n\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question,\n\nwith some surprise at her silence.\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not\n\nimmediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I\n\nknow, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of\n\ndespising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those  kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated  contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that\n\nI do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you\n\ndare.\"\n \n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\n \nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was\n\namazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness\n\nand archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to\n\naffront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by  any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it\n\nnot for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some\n\ndanger.\n\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane\n\nreceived some assistance from her desire of getting rid of\n\nElizabeth.\n \nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his\n\nhappiness in such an alliance.\n\n\n\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the\n\nshrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a\n\nfew hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the\n\nadvantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it,  do sure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I  may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that\n\nlittle something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\n\nwhich your lady possesses.\"\n\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic\n\nfelicity?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt\n\nPhillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's\n\npicture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do\n\njustice to those beautiful eyes?\"\n\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but\n\ntheir colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,\n\nmight be copied.\"\n\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs.\n\nHurst and Elizabeth herself.\n \n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss\n\nBingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\n\n\n\n\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst,\n\n\"running away without telling us that you were coming out.\"\n\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left\n\nElizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr.\n\nDarcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:\n\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better\n\ngo into the avenue.\"\n\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain\n\nwith them, laughingly answered:\n\n\"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped,\n\nand appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would\n\nbe spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.\"\n\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was\n\nalready so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a\n\ncouple of hours that evening.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 11.\n\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two\n\nfriends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had\n\nnever seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour  which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of  conversation were considerable. They could describe an\n\nentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour,\n\nand laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.\n\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward\n\nDarcy, and she had something to say to him before he had\n\nadvanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet,  with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight  bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness and warmth\n\nremained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and\n\nattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire,  lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she  removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that\n\nshe might be further from the door. He then sat down by her,\n\nand talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the\n\nopposite corner, saw it all with great delight.\n\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law\n\nof the card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private\n\nintelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.\n\n\n\nHurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole\n\nparty on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had\n\ntherefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the  sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did  the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing\n\nwith her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her\n\nbrother's conversation with Miss Bennet.\n \nMiss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through HIS book, as in\n\nreading her own; and she was perpetually either making some\n\ninquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him,  however, to any conversation; he merely answered her  question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the\n\nattempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only\n\nchosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a  great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it is to spend an evening  in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like\n\nreading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\n\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if\n\nI have not an excellent library.\"\n\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw\n\naside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for\n\nsome amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball\n\nto Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\n\n\n\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a\n\ndance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you deter\n\nmine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am\n\nmuch mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball\n\nwould be rather a punishment than a pleasure.\"\n\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed,\n\nif he chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a\n\nsettled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup\n\nenough, I shall send round my cards.\"\n\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they\n\nwere carried on in a different manner; but there is something\n\ninsufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It  would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of  dancing were made the order of the day.\"\n\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it\n\nwould not be near so much like a ball.\"\n \nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant,\n\nand she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed,\n\nwas still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings,  she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth,\n\nsaid:\n\n\n\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my\n\nexample, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is\n\nvery refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.\"\n\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss  Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility;  Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of\n\nattention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and\n\nunconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join  their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine  but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the\n\nroom together, with either of which motives his joining them\n\nwould interfere. \"What could he mean? She was dying to  know what could be his meaning?\"--and asked Elizabeth\n\nwhether she could at all understand him?\n \n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he\n\nmeans to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing\n\nhim will be to ask nothing about it.\"\n\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing\n\nMr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring\n\nan explanation of his two motives.\n\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said\n\nhe, as soon as she allowed him to speak. \"You either choose\n\nthis method of passing the evening because you are in each\n\nother's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or\n\nbecause you are conscious that your figures appear to the\n\n\n\ngreatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be  completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you\n\nmuch better as I sit by the fire.\"\n\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard  anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a  speech?\"\n\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said\n\nElizabeth. \"We can all plague and punish one another. Tease\n\nhim- laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it\n\nis to be done.\"\n \n\"But upon my honour, I do NOT. I do assure you that my\n\nintimacy has not yet taught me THAT. Tease calmness of  manner and presence of mind! No, no--feel he may defy us  there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you\n\nplease, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy\n\nmay hug himself.\"\n\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That\n\nis an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will\n\ncontinue, for it would be a great loss to ME to have many\n\nsuch acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.\"\n\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than\n\ncan be. The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and\n\nbest of their actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person\n\nwhose first object in life is a joke.\"\n\n\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I\n\nhope I am not one of THEM. I hope I never ridicule what is\n\nwise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and\n\ninconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them  whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you\n\nare without.\"\n \n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been\n\nthe study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often\n\nexpose a strong understanding to ridicule.\"\n\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\n\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there\n\nis a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\n\nregulation.\"\n\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said\n\nMiss Bingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\n\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no\n\ndefect. He owns it himself without disguise.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have\n\nfaults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My  temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot\n\n\n\nforget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor  their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed\n\nabout with every attempt to move them. My temper would\n\nperhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost\n\nforever.\"\n \n\"THAT is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable\n\nresentment IS a shade in a character. But you have chosen\n\nyour fault well. I really cannot LAUGH at it. You are safe\n\nfrom me.\"\n \n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to\n\nsome particular evil--a natural defect, which not even the best\n\neducation can overcome.\"\n \n\"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.\"\n\n\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to\n\nmisunderstand them.\"\n \n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of  a conversation in which she had no share. \"Louisa, you will  not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?\"\n\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the piano\n\nforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments'  recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger  of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\n\n\n\nChapter 12.\n\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters,  Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.\n\nBut Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters\n\nremaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which  would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to  receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was\n\nnot propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was\n\nimpatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they  could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in  her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister\n\npressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.\n\nAgainst staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding\n\nthemselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr.\n\nBingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\n\nThe communication excited many professions of concern;\n\nand enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the  following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going  was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had\n\nproposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister\n\nmuch exceeded her affection for the other.\n\n\n\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss\n\nBennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not\n\nenough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to\n\nbe right.\n\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had\n\nbeen at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than\n\nhe liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more  teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be  particularly careful that no sign of admiration should NOW\n\nescape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\n\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been  suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have  material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his\n\npurpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole\n\nof Saturday, and though they were at one time left by  themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously\n\nto his book, and would not even look at her.\n \nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so\n\nagreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to  Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her  affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the\n\nlatter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either\n\nat Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most  tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth  took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.\n\n\n\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought\n\nthem very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane\n\nwould have caught cold again. But their father, though very  laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see  them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\n\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost\n\nmuch of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence\n\nof Jane and Elizabeth.\n \nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-\n\nbass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and\n\nsome new observations of threadbare morality to listen to.  Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different\n\nsort. Much had been done and much had been said in the\n\nregiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the\n\nofficers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been  flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster  was going to be married.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 13.\n\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they  were at breakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a  good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an\n\naddition to our family party.\"\n\n\"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is  coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to  call in--and I hope MY dinners are good enough for her. I do\n\nnot believe she often sees such at home.\"\n \n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a\n\nstranger.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. \"A gentleman and a stranger!\n\nIt is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be\n\nextremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But--good Lord! how  unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my  love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this moment.\"\n\n\"It is NOT Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person\n\nwhom I never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\n\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five\n\ndaughters at once.\n\n\n\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he\n\nthus explained:\n\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a\n\nfortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some  delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin,  Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of\n\nthis house as soon as he pleases.\"\n\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that  mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is  the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be\n\nentailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had\n\nbeen you, I should have tried long ago to do something or\n\nother about it.\"\n \nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an\n\nentail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a\n\nsubject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason,  and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling  an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a\n\nman whom nobody cared anything about.\n\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet,  \"and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting  Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may\n\nperhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing\n\nhimself.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very\n\nimpertinent of him to write to you at all, and very\n\nhypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep\n\non quarreling with you, as his father did before him?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial\n\nscruples on that head, as you will hear.\"\n\n\"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\n\n\"Dear Sir,-\n \n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my\n\nlate honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and\n\nsince I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently\n\nwished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back  by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to  his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with\n\nwhom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There,\n\nMrs. Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the\n\nRight Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir\n\nLewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful\n\nrespect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform\n\nthose rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church  of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to\n\n\n\npromote and establish the blessing of peace in all families  within in the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I\n\nflatter myself that my present overtures are highly\n\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in  the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on  your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.\n\nI cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of\n\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise  for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them  every possible amends--but of this hereafter. If you should\n\nhave no objection to receive me into your house, I propose\n\nmyself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family,  Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably  trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday night following,\n\nwhich I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine\n\nis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday,  provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty  of the day.--I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to\n\nyour lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,\n\n\"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\n \n\"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peacemaking gentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the\n\nletter. \"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young\n\nman, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable  acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so  indulgent as to let him come to us again.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls,\n\nhowever, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I\n\nshall not be the person to discourage him.\"\n\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he\n\ncan mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the\n\nwish is certainly to his credit.\"\n\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference\n\nfor Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening,  marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were  required.\n\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she. \"I cannot make\n\nhim out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And  what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.--Could he be\n\na sensible man, sir?\"\n\n\"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding  him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient\n\nto see him.\"\n \n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not  seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not  wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\n\n\n\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that\n\ntheir cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now\n\nsome weeks since they had received pleasure from the society  of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr.  Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she\n\nwas preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\n\nastonished her husband and daughters.\n\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed\n\nsaid little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.\n\nCollins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of fiveand-twenty. His air was grave and stately,\n\nand his manners were very formal. He had not been long\n\nseated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine  a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty,\n\nbut that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and\n\nadded, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time\n\ndisposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the  taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled  with no compliments, answered most readily.\n\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart\n\nit may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things\n\nare settled so oddly.\"\n\n\n\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor\n\ngirls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with\n\nYOU, for such things I know are all chance in this world.  There is no knowing how estates will go when once they\n\ncome to be entailed.\"\n \n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair\n\ncousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am  cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can  assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.\n\nAt present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are\n\nbetter acquainted--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr.\n\nCollins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its\n\nfurniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation  of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for  the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own\n\nfuture property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired;\n\nand he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the  excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right  there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity\n\nthat they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that\n\nher daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged  pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she\n\n\n\ndeclared herself not at all offended; but he continued to\n\napologise for about a quarter of an hour.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 14.\n\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\n\nwhich he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed\n\nvery fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's\n\nattention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,\n\nappeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\n\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject\n\nelevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and  with a most important aspect he protested that \"he had never  in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such\n\naffability and condescension, as he had himself experienced\n\nfrom Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to  approve of both of the discourses which he had already had  the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him\n\ntwice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the\n\nSaturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never seen anything but affability in her.\n\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other\n\ngentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining  in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the  parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.\n\nShe had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as\n\nhe could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once  paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had\n\n\n\nperfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and  had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself--some shelves in\n\nthe closet upstairs.\"\n\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs.  Bennet, \"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a  pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does\n\nshe live near you, sir?\"\n\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is\n\nseparated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's\n\nresidence.\"\n \n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any\n\nfamily?\"\n\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of\n\nvery extensive property.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is\n\nbetter off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is\n\nshe? Is she handsome?\"\n \n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady\n\nCatherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de\n\nBourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\n\nconstitution, which has prevented her from making that\n\n\n\nprogress in many accomplishments which she could not have  otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who\n\nsuperintended her education, and who still resides with them.\n\nBut she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\n\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name\n\namong the ladies at court.\"\n\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her  being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine  one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest\n\nornaments. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and\n\nyou may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer  those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable  to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine,\n\nthat her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and\n\nthat the most elevated rank, instead of giving her  consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of  little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of\n\nattention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.\"\n\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is  happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with  delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed\n\nfrom the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous\n\nstudy?\"\n\n\n\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and\n\nthough I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and\n\narranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted\n\nto ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied\n\nan air as possible.\"\n\nMr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin\n\nwas as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the\n\nkeenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most  resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an  occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his\n\npleasure.\n\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.  Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read\n\naloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book\n\nwas produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced  it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and  begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty\n\nstared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were\n\nproduced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's  Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he  had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\n\ninterrupted him with:\n\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of\n\nturning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will\n\n\n\nhire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk  to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when\n\nMr. Denny comes back from town.\"\n\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue;\n\nbut Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\n \n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are\n\ninterested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely\n\nfor their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there  can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I  will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\n\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his\n\nantagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the  challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the  girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her\n\ndaughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and\n\npromised that it should not occur again, if he would resume  his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his  young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her\n\nbehaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with\n\nMr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.\n\n\n\nChapter 15.\n\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance\n\nof an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to\n\none of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary  terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The  subjection in which his father had brought him up had given\n\nhim originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\n\ngood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head,  living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early  and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had\n\nrecommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the\n\nliving of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt\n\nfor her high rank,\n\nand his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a\n\nvery good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman,\n\nand his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\n\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\n\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he\n\nintended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the\n\nLongbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This\n\nwas his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their\n\nfather's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of\n\n\n\neligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and\n\ndisinterested on his own part.\n\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely\n\nface confirmed his views, and established all his strictest\n\nnotions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening  SHE was his settled choice. The next morning, however,\n\nmade an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete\n\nwith Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning  with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal  of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at\n\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles\n\nand general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he  had fixed on. \"As to her YOUNGER daughters, she could not  take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she\n\ndid not KNOW of any prepossession; her ELDEST daughter,\n\nshe must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint,\n\nwas likely to be very soon engaged.\"\n\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-and\n\nit was soon done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the\n\nfire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty,\n\nsucceeded her of course.\n \nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she\n\nmight soon have two daughters married; and the man whom\n\nshe could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in\n\nher good graces.\n\n\n\nLydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.\n\nCollins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who\n\nwas most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to\n\nhimself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after\n\nbreakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged\n\nwith one of the largest folios in the collection, but really\n\ntalking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and  garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet  exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure\n\nand tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to\n\nmeet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house,  he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,  was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters\n\nin their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted\n\nfor a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his\n\nlarge book, and go.\n\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that\n\nof his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The\n\nattention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained  by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the  street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very\n\nsmart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop\n\nwindow, could recall them.\n \nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most\n\n\n\ngentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the  other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny\n\nconcerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,\n\nand he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the  stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and  Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across\n\nthe street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite\n\nshop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the  two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr.  Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\n\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\n\nhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had  accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it  should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to\n\nmake him completely charming. His appearance was greatly\n\nin his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine  countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The  introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\n\nof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct\n\nand unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and  talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses  drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding\n\ndown the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the\n\ntwo gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the  usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and  Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his\n\nway to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy\n\ncorroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine\n\n\n\nnot to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly  arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening\n\nto see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\n\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both  changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr.\n\nWickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation\n\nwhich Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the\n\nmeaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible\n\nnot to long to know.\n\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to\n\nhave noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his\n\nfriend.\n \nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their\n\nbows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they\n\nshould come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing\n\nup the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.\n\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the\n\ntwo eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly\n\nwelcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their  sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not  fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she\n\nhad not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street,\n\nwho had told her that they were not to send any more draughts  to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away,\n\n\n\nwhen her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's  introduction of him. She received him with her very best\n\npoliteness, which he returned with as much more, apologising\n\nfor his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her,  which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be  justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\n\nintroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by\n\nsuch an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one  stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries  about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her\n\nnieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought\n\nhim from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's\n\ncommission in the ---shire. She had been watching him the  last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and\n\nhad Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly\n\nhave continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed  windows now except a few of the officers, who, in  comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\n\ndisagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the\n\nPhillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the\n\nevening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that\n\nthey would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery  tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect  of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual\n\ngood spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the\n\n\n\nroom, and was assured with unwearying civility that they\n\nwere perfectly needless.\n\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she\n\nhad seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane  would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be  in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than\n\nher sister.\n \nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never\n\nseen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received\n\nhim with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him  in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly  unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\n\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never\n\nmet with so much attention in the whole course of his life.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 16.\n\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his\n\nvisit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and\n\nhis five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls  had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,  that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and\n\nwas then in the house.\n \nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken\n\ntheir seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and\n\nadmire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture\n\nof the apartment, that he declared he might almost have\n\nsupposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at  Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much  gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him\n\nwhat Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had\n\nlistened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's  drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had  cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the\n\ncompliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\n\nwith the housekeeper's room.\n\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own\n\nhumble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was\n\nhappily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he\n\n\n\nfound in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion  of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who\n\nwas resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as\n\nshe could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,  and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\n\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\n\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was\n\nover at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when\n\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she\n\nhad neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since,\n\nwith the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\n\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,  gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present  party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person,\n\ncountenance, air, and walk, as THEY were superior to the\n\nbroad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who\n\nfollowed them into the room.\n \nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost\n\nevery female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy\n\nwoman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable  manner in which he immediately fell into conversation,  though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that\n\nthe commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be\n\nrendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.\n\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham\n\nand the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into\n\n\n\ninsignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing;  but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and\n\nwas by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with\n\ncoffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had  the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to\n\nwhist.\n \n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall\n\nbe glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs.  Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait\n\nfor his reason.\n \nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight\n\nwas he received at the other table between Elizabeth and\n\nLydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being\n\nlikewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too\n\nmuch interested in the game, too eager in making bets and  exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in  particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game,\n\nMr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and\n\nshe was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly  wished to hear she could not hope to be told--the history of  his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention\n\nthat gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\n\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired  how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving\n\n\n\nher answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy\n\nhad been staying there.\n\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let\n\nthe subject drop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in\n\nDerbyshire, I understand.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble\n\none. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met\n\nwith a person more capable of giving you certain information  on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his  family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\n\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\n\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an  assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold  manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted\n\nwith Mr. Darcy?\"\n\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very  warmly. \"I have spent four days in the same house with him,  and I think him very disagreeable.\"\n\n\"I have no right to give MY opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as\n\nto his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form  one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair  judge. It is impossible for ME to be impartial. But I believe\n\nyour opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps\n\n\n\nyou would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.\n\nHere you are in your own family.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in\n\nany house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not  at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his  pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by\n\nanyone.\"\n\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short  interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated  beyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often\n\nhappen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\n\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\n\nonly as he chooses to be seen.\"\n\n\"I should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be\n\nan ill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\n\n\"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\n\n\"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going\n\naway when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour\n\nof the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the\n\nneighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Oh! no--it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.\n\nIf HE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go. We are not on\n\n\n\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I  have no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim\n\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\n\npainful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss  Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever\n\nbreathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\n\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the\n\nsoul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to  myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could  forgive him anything and everything, rather than his\n\ndisappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his\n\nfather.\"\n \nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented\n\nfurther inquiry.\n\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics,  Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter\n\nwith gentle but very intelligible gallantry.\n\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\"  he added, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the --shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and\n\nmy friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their\n\npresent quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent  acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is\n\n\n\nnecessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my  spirits will not bear solitude. I MUST have employment and\n\nsociety. A military life is not what I was intended for, but\n\ncircumstances have now made it eligible. The church OUGHT  to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church,  and I should at this time have been in possession of a most\n\nvaluable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were\n\nspeaking of just now.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n \n\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next\n\npresentation of the best living in his gift. He was my\n\ngodfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice  to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and  thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\n\nelsewhere.\"\n \n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could THAT\n\nbe? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek\n\nlegal redress?\"\n\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the\n\nbequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour  could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to  doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional\n\nrecommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to\n\nit by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago,\n\n\n\nexactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to\n\nanother man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse\n\nmyself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I\n\nhave a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my  opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely. I can recall nothing  worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men,\n\nand that he hates me.\"\n \n\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly\n\ndisgraced.\"\n\n\"Some time or other he WILL be--but it shall not be by\n\nME. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose\n\nHIM.\"\n \nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\n\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.\n\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his\n\nmotive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\n\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I\n\ncannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late\n\nMr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me\n\nbetter; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated\n\nhim, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear  the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\n\npreference which was often given me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have\n\nnever liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had\n\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general,\n\nbut did not suspect him of descending to such malicious\n\nrevenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, \"I\n\nDO remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\n\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\n\ntemper. His disposition must be dreadful.\"\n\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham;\n\n\"I can hardly be just to him.\"\n\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!\" She could have added, \"A young\n\nman, too, like YOU, whose very countenance may vouch for\n\nyour being amiable\"--but she contented herself with, \"and  one, too, who had probably been his companion from  childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the\n\nclosest manner!\"\n \n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park;  the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of  the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the\n\nsame parental care. MY father began life in the profession\n\nwhich your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit  to--but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr.\n\n\n\nDarcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\n\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged\n\nhimself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's  active superintendence, and when, immediately before my  father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of\n\nproviding for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much\n\na debt of gratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable! I\n\nwonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made\n\nhim just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not\n\nhave been too proud to be dishonest--for dishonesty I must\n\ncall it.\"\n \n\"It IS wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his\n\nactions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his\n\nbest friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with\n\nany other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his  behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than\n\npride.\"\n\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him\n\ngood?\"\n\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to\n\ngive his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his\n\ntenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and FILIAL pride-for he is very proud of what his father was--have done this.\n\n\n\nNot to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley\n\nHouse, is a powerful motive. He has also BROTHERLY\n\npride, which, with SOME brotherly affection, makes him a  very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear  him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of\n\nbrothers.\"\n \n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It\n\ngives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like\n\nher brother--very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate\n\nand pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted  hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me  now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\n\nunderstand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her\n\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\n\nsuperintends her education.\"\n\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects,\n\nElizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and\n\nsaying:\n\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How\n\ncan Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I\n\nreally believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a\n\nman? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr.\n\nBingley?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n \n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He\n\ncannot know what Mr. Darcy is.\"\n\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.\n\nHe does not want abilities. He can be a conversible\n\ncompanion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who\n\nare at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man\n\nfrom what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts  him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere,  rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing\n\nsomething for fortune and figure.\"\n\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual\n\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter. It had not\n\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.  Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured  her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\n\nimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and\n\nbegged that she would not make herself uneasy.\n\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit\n\ndown to a card-table, they must take their chances of these\n\nthings, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make\n\nfive shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who  could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de\n\n\n\nBourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\n\nlittle matters.\"\n \nMr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing\n\nMr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low\n\nvoice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted\n\nwith the family of de Bourgh.\n\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately\n\ngiven him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first  introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her  long.\"\n\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and\n\nLady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady\n\nCatherine's connections. I never heard of her existence till the\n\nday before yesterday.\"\n\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large\n\nfortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite\n\nthe two estates.\"\n \nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of\n\nhimself, if he were already self-destined for another.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady\n\nCatherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he\n\nhas related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads\n\nhim, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an\n\narrogant, conceited woman.\"\n\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied\n\nWickham; \"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well\n\nremember that I never liked her, and that her manners were\n\ndictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being  remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she\n\nderives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part\n\nfrom her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for  her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him  should have an understanding of the first class.\"\n\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account\n\nof it, and they continued talking together, with mutual  satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of\n\nthe ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There\n\ncould be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper\n\nparty, but his manners recommended him to everybody.\n\nWhatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\n\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.\n\nShe could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what\n\nhe had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for  her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia  nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of\n\n\n\nlottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had  won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\n\nMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his\n\nlosses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and  repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to  say than he could well man age before the carriage stopped at\n\nLongbourn House.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 17.\n\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed\n\nbetween Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with\n\nastonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that\n\nMr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and\n\nyet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young  man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility  of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest\n\nall her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\n\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of\n\neach, and throw into the account of accident or mistake\n\nwhatever could not be otherwise explained.\n\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in\n\nsome way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested  people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in  short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or\n\ncircumstances which may have alienated them, without actual\n\nblame on either side.\"\n \n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you\n\ngot to say on behalf of the interested people who have\n\nprobably been concerned in the business? Do clear THEM\n\ntoo, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\"\n\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me\n\nout of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what\n\na disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his\n\n\n\nfather's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had\n\npromised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common\n\nhumanity, no man who had any value for his character, could\n\nbe capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\n\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\"\n\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being\n\nimposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a\n\nhistory of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts,  everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let  Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.\"\n\n\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know\n\nwhat to think.\"\n \n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\n\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point-that\n\nMr. Bingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much\n\nto suffer when the affair became public.\n\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very\n\npersons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his\n\nsisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the  following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their\n\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\n\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since\n\n\n\ntheir separation. To the rest of the family they paid little  attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying\n\nnot much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They\n\nwere soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity  which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if  eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\n\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely\n\nagreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to  consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and  was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr.\n\nBingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured\n\nto herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends,  and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth thought with  pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of\n\nseeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and\n\nbehavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia  depended less on any single event, or any particular person,  for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the\n\nevening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only\n\npartner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a  ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no\n\ndisinclination for it.\n \n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is\n\nenough--I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in  evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I\n\n\n\nprofess myself one of those who consider intervals of\n\nrecreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.\"\n\nElizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that\n\nthough she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins,  she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept  Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think\n\nit proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was\n\nrather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple  whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a  rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de\n\nBourgh, by venturing to dance.\n\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he,  \"that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to  respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so\n\nfar from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\n\nhonoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of  the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,  Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a\n\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the\n\nright cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\n\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very\n\ndances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had\n\nnever been worse timed. There was no help for it, however.  Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed\n\n\n\na little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as  good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with\n\nhis gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It\n\nnow first struck her, that SHE was selected from among her  sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage,  and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the\n\nabsence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to\n\nconviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward  herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her  wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified\n\nherself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her\n\nmother gave her to understand that the probability of their  marriage was extremely agreeable to HER. Elizabeth,  however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware\n\nthat a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.\n\nMr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\n\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and\n\ntalk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very\n\npitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to  the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as  prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no\n\nofficers, no news could be sought after--the very shoe-roses\n\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have  found some trial of her patience in weather which totally  suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.\n\nWickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could\n\n\n\nhave made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\n\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 18.\n\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never\n\noccurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been\n\nchecked by any of those recollections that might not  unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more  than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the\n\nconquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting\n\nthat it was not more than might be won in the course of the  evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his  being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the\n\nBingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not\n\nexactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was  pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly  applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to\n\ngo to town on business the day before, and was not yet\n\nreturned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not imagine  his business would have called him away just now, if he had  not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\n\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\n\ncaught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\n\nless answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first\n\nsurmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the\n\nformer was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that\n\nshe could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite in\n\n\n\nquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.  Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to\n\nWickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation\n\nwith him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which  she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr.  Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\n\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though\n\nevery prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it  could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her  griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week,\n\nshe was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the\n\noddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular  notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of  distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins,\n\nawkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and\n\noften moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all  the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a  couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\n\nhim was ecstasy.\n\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment\n\nof talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally\n\nliked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte\n\nLucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found\n\nherself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so  much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without  knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away\n\n\n\nagain immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want\n\nof presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:\n\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid! THAT would be the greatest misfortune\n\nof all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to\n\nhate! Do not wish me such an evil.\"\n \nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy\n\napproached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help  cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow  her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the\n\neyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\n\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to  which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to  Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal\n\namazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without\n\nspeaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence  was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved  not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the\n\ngreater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she\n\nmade some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and  was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she  addressed him a second time with:--\"It is YOUR turn to say\n\nsomething now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and\n\nYOU ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\n\n\n\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him\n\nto say should be said.\n\n\"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by\n\nand by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter\n\nthan public ones. But NOW we may be silent.\"\n\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would\n\nlook odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet  for the advantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so  arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little\n\nas possible.\"\n\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case,\n\nor do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\n\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a\n\ngreat similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an\n\nunsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we  expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and  be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\n\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own\n\ncharacter, I am sure,\" said he. \"How near it may be to MINE,  I cannot pretend to say. YOU think it a faithful portrait  undoubtedly.\"\n\n\n\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\n\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they\n\nhad gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her\n\nsisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in  the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added,  \"When you met us there the other day, we had just been\n\nforming a new acquaintance.\"\n\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go\n\non. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,\n\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may  ensure his MAKING friends--whether he may be equally  capable of RETAINING them, is less certain.\"\n\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship,\"\n\nreplied Elizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is\n\nlikely to suffer from all his life.\"\n\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing\n\nthe subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared\n\nclose to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other  side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped  with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\n\ndancing and his partner.\n\n\n\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.\n\nSuch very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that\n\nyou belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that\n\nyour fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope  to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain  desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and\n\nBingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow\n\nin! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir.  You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching  converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also up\n\nbraiding me.\"\n\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy;\n\nbut Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him\n\nforcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious\n\nexpression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing\n\ntogether. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to  his partner, and said, \"Sir William's interruption has made me  forget what we were talking of.\"\n\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could\n\nnot have interrupted two people in the room who had less to  say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects  already without success, and what we are to talk of next I\n\ncannot imagine.\"\n\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\n\n\n\n\"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not\n\nwith the same feelings.\"\n\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can\n\nat least be no want of subject. We may compare our different\n\nopinions.\"\n\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is\n\nalways full of something else.\"\n\n\"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes--does\n\nit?\" said he, with a look of doubt.\n \n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said,\n\nfor her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\n\nafterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember  hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever  forgave, that you resentment once created was unappeasable.\n\nYou are very cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING\n\nCREATED.\"\n \n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\n \n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change\n\ntheir opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\"\n\n\n\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\n\n\"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character,\" said she,\n\nendeavouring to shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it\n\nout.\"\n \n\"And what is your success?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such\n\ndifferent accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\n\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports  may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss  Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the\n\npresent moment, as there is reason to fear that the\n\nperformance would reflect no credit on either.\"\n\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have\n\nanother opportunity.\"\n\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he\n\ncoldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the  other dance and parted in silence; and on each side  dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's\n\nbreast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,\n\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger\n\nagainst another.\n\n\n\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted\n\nher:\n \n\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George  Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and  asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man\n\nquite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that\n\nhe was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.  Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give  implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\n\nusing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\n\nalways been remarkably kind to him, though George  Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I  do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr.\n\nDarcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear\n\nGeorge Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that\n\nhe had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the\n\ncountry at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder  how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this  discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his\n\ndescent, one could not expect much better.\"\n\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the  same,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse  him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's\n\n\n\nsteward, and of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me\n\nhimself.\"\n \n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away\n\nwith a sneer. \"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"\n\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself. \"You are much\n\nmistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack\n\nas this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and\n\nthe malice of Mr. Darcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister,  who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of  Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet\n\ncomplacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\n\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the\n\nevening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that  moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his\n\nenemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of\n\nJane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\n\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less\n\nsmiling than her sister's, \"what you have learnt about Mr.\n\nWickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged\n\nto think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of\n\nmy pardon.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have\n\nnothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know\n\nthe whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circum stances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he\n\n\n\nwill vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of  his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has\n\ndeserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\n\nreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his  sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young  man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has\n\ndeserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\n\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\n\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr.\n\nDarcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\n\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though  he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he  believes that it was left to him CONDITIONALLY only.\"\n\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,\" said\n\nElizabeth warmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is\n\nunacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the\n\nrest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\n\nboth gentlemen as I did before.\"\n\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to\n\neach, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\n\n\n\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and\n\nsaid all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their\n\nbeing joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to  Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last  partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up\n\nto them, and told her with great exultation that he had just\n\nbeen so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.\n\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that\n\nthere is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I\n\nhappened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the\n\nyoung lady who does the honours of the house the names of  his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\n\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady\n\nCatherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my\n\nnot having done it before. My total ignorance of the\n\nconnection must plead my apology.\"\n\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\n\n\"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done\n\nit earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's NEPHEW. It\n\nwill be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite\n\nwell yesterday se'nnight.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,\n\nassuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing\n\nhim without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather\n\nthan a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least  necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if  it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\n\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened\n\nto her with the determined air of following his own\n\ninclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:\n\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the\n\nworld in your excellent judgement in all matters within the\n\nscope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there\n\nmust be a wide difference between the established forms of\n\nceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the\n\nclergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the\n\nclerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest  rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\n\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore\n\nallow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\n\noccasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point  of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,  which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\n\nthough in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\n\neducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a  young lady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to  attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly\n\nwatched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was\n\n\n\nvery evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn  bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\n\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words\n\n\"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\" It  vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy  was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last\n\nMr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of\n\ndistant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged  from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed  abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech,\n\nand at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved\n\nanother way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied\n\nwith my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\n\nattention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even\n\npaid me the compliment of saying that he was so well  convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain  she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a\n\nvery handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased\n\nwith him.\"\n \nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister\n\nand Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which\n\nher observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as  happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house,  in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\n\n\n\nbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of  endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's\n\nthoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she\n\ndetermined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too  much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she  considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them\n\nwithin one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\n\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)  freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that  Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an\n\nanimating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of\n\nfatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His  being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but  three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\n\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two\n\nsisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the\n\nconnection as much as she could do. It\n \nwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\n\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in\n\nthe way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her  time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the  care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into\n\ncompany more than she liked. It was necessary to make this\n\ncircumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions  it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet  to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\n\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might\n\n\n\nsoon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly\n\nbelieving there was no chance of it.\n\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of\n\nher mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in  a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she  could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr.\n\nDarcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her\n\nfor being nonsensical.\n\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of\n\nhim? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be\n\nobliged to say nothing HE may not like to hear.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage  can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never  recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!\"\n\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.\n\nHer mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at\n\nMr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she\n\ndreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother,  she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by  her. The expression of his face changed gradually from\n\nindignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.\n\n\n\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and\n\nLady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of\n\ndelights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to\n\nthe comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to  revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when  supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the\n\nmortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\n\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks  and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a  proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not\n\nunderstand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was\n\ndelightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes  were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she  watched her progress through the several stanzas with an\n\nimpatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for\n\nMary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers\n\nwere by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\n\nweak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She  looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very  composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters,\n\nand saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at\n\nDarcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary\n\nhad finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do\n\n\n\nextremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let\n\nthe other young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\n\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat\n\ndisconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her  father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.  Others of the party were now applied to.\n\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to\n\nsing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the  company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent  diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a\n\nclergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be\n\njustified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there  are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a  parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\n\nan agreement for tithes as a may be beneficial to himself and\n\nnot offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons;  and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish  duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which\n\nhe cannot be excused from making as a comfortable as\n\npossible.\n\nAnd I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody,\n\nespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\n\ncannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the  man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect\n\n\n\ntowards anybody connected with the family.\" And with a bow  to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been\n\nspoken so loud as a to be heard by half the room. Many\n\nstared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than  Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.  Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-\n\nwhisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good\n\nkind of young man.\n\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as a much as a they could\n\nduring the evening, it would have been impossible for them to\n\nplay their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy  did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the  exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were\n\nnot of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must\n\nhave witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however,  should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations,  was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the\n\nsilent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the\n\nladies, were more intolerable.\n \nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly\n\nby her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance\n\nwith him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else,  and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He\n\n\n\nassured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to  it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to\n\nrecommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a\n\npoint of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was  no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to  her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\n\ngoodnaturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\n\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough\n\nto speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her\n\nallusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\n\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for\n\ntheir carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was\n\ngone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were  wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister  scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue,\n\nand were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.\n\nThey repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins,\n\nwho was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the\n\nelegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and  politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was\n\n\n\nenjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing  together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to\n\neach other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either\n\nMrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\n\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was\n\nmost pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family  soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr.  Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by\n\neating a family dinner with them at any time, without the\n\nceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful  pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest  opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London,\n\nwhither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.\n\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and\n\nwedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter\n\nsettled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of\n\nhaving another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought  with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal,\n\npleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her\n\nchildren; and though the man and the match were quite good  enough for HER, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr.  Bingley and Netherfield.\n\n\n\nChapter 19.\n\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr.  Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to\n\nthe following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence\n\nto make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set  about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances,  which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\n\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\n\nsoon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\n \n\"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair\n\ndaughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private\n\naudience with her in the course of this morning?\"\n\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she\n\ncan have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\"\n\nAnd, gathering her work together, she was hastening away,\n\nwhen Elizabeth called out:\n \n\"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr.\n\nCollins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me\n\nthat anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.\"\n\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you\n\nare.\" And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and\n\n\n\nembarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I\n\nINSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\n\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a\n\nmoment's consideration making her also sensible that it would  be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she  sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment\n\nthe feelings which were divided between distress and\n\ndiversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\n\nthey were gone, Mr. Collins began.\n\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty,\n\nso far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\n\nperfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes  had there NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to  assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for\n\nthis address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my\n\ndiscourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to  dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be  mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you\n\nout as the companion of my future life. But before I am run\n\naway with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be  advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and,  moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of\n\nselecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\n\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near\n\n\n\nlaughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in\n\nany attempt to stop him further, and he continued:\n\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right\n\nthing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself )  to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I  am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness;\n\nand thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier,\n\nthat it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very  noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\n\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night\n\nbefore I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while  Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that  she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you\n\nmust marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY\n\nsake; and for your OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of  person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income  go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon\n\nas you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow\n\nme, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not  reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh  as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.\n\nYou will find her manners beyond anything I can describe;\n\nand your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,  especially when tempered with the silence and respect which  her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\n\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why\n\n\n\nmy views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my  own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many\n\namiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to\n\ninherit this estate after the death of your honoured father  (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not  satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among\n\nhis daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as\n\npossible, when the melancholy event takes place--which,  however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.  This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself\n\nit will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains\n\nbut for me but to assure you in the most animated language of  the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly  indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your\n\nfather, since I am well aware that it could not be complied\n\nwith; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents,  which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all  that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I\n\nshall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no\n\nungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are\n\nmarried.\"\n \nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have\n\nmade no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time.\n\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I\n\n\n\nam very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is\n\nimpossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\n\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal\n\nwave of the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject  the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept,  when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the\n\nrefusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am\n\ntherefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\n\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a\n\nrather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you\n\nthat I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies  there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the  chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in\n\nmy refusal. You could not make ME happy, and I am\n\nconvinced that I am the last woman in the world who could\n\nmake you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know  me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill\n\nqualified for the situation.\"\n\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said  Mr. Collins very gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her  ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be\n\ncertain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall\n\nspeak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy,\n\nand other amiable qualification.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.\n\nYou must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the\n\ncompliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy\n\nand very rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to  prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you  must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard\n\nto my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate\n\nwhenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may  be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she  thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins\n\nnot thus addressed her:\n \n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on  the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer  than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing\n\nyou of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the\n\nestablished custom of your sex to reject a man on the first  application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to  encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true\n\ndelicacy of the female character.\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth,  \"you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can  appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how\n\nto express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its\n\nbeing one.\"\n\n\n\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin,\n\nthat your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.\n\nMy reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not\n\nappear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or  that the establishment I can offer would be any other than  highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the\n\nfamily of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\n\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it  into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold  attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of\n\nmarriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so\n\nsmall that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your  loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore  conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\n\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love\n\nby suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant\n\nfemales.\"\n \n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to\n\nthat kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a\n\nrespectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of  being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the  honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept\n\nthem is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\n\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an  elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational  creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of\n\nawkward gallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned\n\nby the express authority of both your excellent parents, my\n\nproposals will not fail of being acceptable.\"\n\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence\n\nwithdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her\n\nrepeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her  father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to\n\nbe decisive, and whose behavior at least could not be\n\nmistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant\n\nfemale.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 20.\n\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in\n\nthe vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner\n\nsaw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her\n\ntowards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room,\n\nand congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the  happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\n\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure,\n\nand then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview,  with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be  satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly\n\ngiven him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and\n\nthe genuine delicacy of her character.\n\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she\n\nwould have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter\n\nhad meant to encourage him by protesting against his\n\nproposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help\n\nsaying so.\n\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy\n\nshall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly.\n\nShe is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her\n\nown interest but I will MAKE her know it.\"\n \n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr.\n\nCollins; \"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know\n\n\n\nnot whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a  man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the\n\nmarriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting\n\nmy suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting  me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not  contribute much to my felicity.\"\n\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\n\nalarmed. \"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In  everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I  will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it\n\nwith her, I am sure.\"\n\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,  \"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in\n\nan uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins,\n\nfor she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make\n\nhaste he will change his mind and not have HER.\"\n\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered,\n\nand fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was\n\nnot in the least altered by her communication.\n\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he,\n\nwhen she had finished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\n\n\n\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not\n\nhave Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will\n\nnot have Lizzy.\"\n\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an\n\nhopeless business.\"\n\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist\n\nupon her marrying him.\"\n\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was\n\nsummoned to the library.\n\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I\n\nhave sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that  Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\"  Elizabeth replied that it was. \"Very well--and this offer of\n\nmarriage you have refused?\"\n\n\"I have, sir.\"\n \n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother\n\ninsists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\n\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\n\n\n\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From  this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.\n\nYour mother will never see you again if you do NOT\n\nmarry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you\n\nDO.\"\n \nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such\n\na beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that\n\nher husband regarded the affair as she wished, was\n\nexcessively disappointed.\n\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You\n\npromised me to INSIST upon her marrying him.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours  to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my  understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\n\nroom. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\n\nmay be.\"\n\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to\n\nElizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.\n\nShe endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with\n\nall possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth,  sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful\n\ngaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied,\n\nhowever, her determination never did.\n\n\n\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to\n\ncomprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and\n\nthough his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His  regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her  deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any\n\nregret.\n \nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper,\n\n\"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do\n\nyou think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made\n\nan offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\n\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were\n\njoined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no\n\nsooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs.  Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject,  calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her\n\nto persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all\n\nher family. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a  melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes  part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor\n\nnerves.\"\n \nCharlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\n\nElizabeth.\n\n\n\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking\n\nas unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if\n\nwe were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I\n\ntell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it into your head to go on  refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never  get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to\n\nmaintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to\n\nkeep you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this  very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should  never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my\n\nword. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not\n\nthat I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have  no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer!\n\nBut it is always so. Those who do not complain are never\n\npitied.\"\n\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\n\nincrease the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without\n\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.  Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than  usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I\n\ndo insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\n\nlet me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.\"\n\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all\n\n\n\nshe could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.  Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were\n\nvery minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself\n\nwith walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a  doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation:\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\n \n\"My dear madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on\n\nthis point. Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a  voice that marked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of  your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty\n\nof us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so\n\nfortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am  resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my  positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her\n\nhand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so\n\nperfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat  of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider  me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam,\n\nby thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's\n\nfavour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the  compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in  my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having\n\naccepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of\n\nyour own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant  well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an  amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the\n\n\n\nadvantage of all your family, and if my MANNER has been at\n\nall reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 21.\n\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some\n\npeevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself,\n\nHIS feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\n\nassiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\n\nwere transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose  civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all,  and especially to her friend.\n\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-\n\nhumour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of\n\nangry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might  shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least\n\naffected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and\n\nto Saturday he meant to stay.\n\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if\n\nMr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence\n\nfrom the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the\n\ntown, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and  vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over.  To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the\n\nnecessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed.\n\n\n\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better\n\nnot meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same\n\nparty with him for so many hours together, might be more\n\nthan I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to\n\nmore than myself.\"\n\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure\n\nfor a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which\n\nthey civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another  officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the  walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them\n\nwas a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered\n\nto herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of\n\nintroducing him to her father and mother.\n\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss\n\nBennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a\n\nsheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a  lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's  countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling\n\nintently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself\n\nsoon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual  cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an  anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from\n\nWickham; and no sooner had he and he companion taken\n\nleave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her  upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking\n\nout the letter, said:\n\n\n\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has\n\nsurprised me a good deal. The whole party have left\n\nNetherfield by this time, and are on their way to town--and\n\nwithout any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\n\nwhat she says.\"\n\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised\n\nthe information of their having just resolved to follow their\n\nbrother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in\n\nGrosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was\n\nin these words: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall\n\nleave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;\n\nbut we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns  of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the  meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very\n\nfrequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on\n\nyou for that.\" To these highflown expressions Elizabeth  listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the  suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in\n\nit really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence\n\nfrom Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there;  and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane  must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\n\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you\n\nshould not be able to see your friends before they leave the  country. But may we not hope that the period of future  happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive\n\n\n\nearlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse  you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\n\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in\n\nLondon by them.\"\n\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return\n\ninto Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\"\n\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the\n\nbusiness which took him to London might be concluded in  three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at  the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he\n\nwill be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on\n\nfollowing him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his  vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my  acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I\n\ncould hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of\n\nmaking one of the crowd--but of that I despair. I sincerely  hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the  gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your\n\nbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss\n\nof the three of whom we shall deprive you.\"\n\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no\n\nmore this winter.\"\n \n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\n\nSHOULD.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is\n\nhis own master. But you do not know ALL. I WILL read you\n\nthe passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no\n\nreserves from YOU.\"\n \n\"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess\n\nthe truth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I\n\nreally do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty,\n\nelegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires  in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more  interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being\n\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\n\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not  leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will  not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her\n\ngreatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of\n\nseeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish  the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is  not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable\n\nof engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances\n\nto favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I  wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event  which will secure the happiness of so many?\"\n\n\"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"\n\nsaid Jane as she finished it. \"Is it not clear enough? Does it not  expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me  to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's\n\n\n\nindifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings  for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?\n\nCan there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\n\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear\n\nit?\"\n \n\"Most willingly.\"\n\n\"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that\n\nher brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss  Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there,  and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\n\nJane shook her head.\n \n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has  ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley,  I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have\n\nseen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would\n\nhave ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are  not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more  anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\n\nwhen there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less\n\ntrouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some  ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh  were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot\n\nseriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her\n\nbrother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\n\n\n\ndegree less sensible of YOUR merit than when he took leave  of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade\n\nhim that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in\n\nlove with her friend.\"\n \n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\n\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I\n\nknow the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of\n\nwilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case\n\nis that she is deceiving herself.\"\n\n\"That is right. You could not have started a more happy\n\nidea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to\n\nbe deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by\n\nher, and must fret no longer.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the\n\nbest, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all\n\nwishing him to marry elsewhere?\"\n\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if,\n\nupon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of\n\ndisobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the\n\nhappiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to\n\nrefuse him.\"\n \n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling. \"You\n\nmust know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at\n\ntheir disapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\n\n\n\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I\n\ncannot consider your situation with much compassion.\"\n\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will\n\nnever be required. A thousand things may arise in six\n\nmonths!\"\n \nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with\n\nthe utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion\n\nof Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a\n\nmoment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully  spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent\n\nof everyone.\n\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was\n\ngradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\n\nsometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\n\nNetherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\n\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the\n\ndeparture of the family, without being alarmed on the score of\n\nthe gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication  gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as  exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away\n\njust as they were all getting so intimate together. After\n\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation  that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining\n\n\n\nat Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable  declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family\n\ndinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 22.\n\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of\n\nthanking her. \"It keeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I\n\nam more obliged to you than I can express.\" Charlotte assured  her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply  repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very\n\namiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than\n\nElizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's\n\nscheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they\n\nparted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if\n\nhe had\n \nnot been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did\n\ninjustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it\n\nled him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning  with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\n\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his\n\ncousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they\n\ncould not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing  to have the attempt known till its success might be known  likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason,\n\nfor Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was\n\ncomparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHis reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss  Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked\n\ntowards the house, and instantly set out to meet him\n\naccidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that\n\nso much love and eloquence awaited her there.\n\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would\n\nallow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction\n\nof both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated  her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of  men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the\n\npresent, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his\n\nhappiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by  nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could\n\nmake a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who\n\naccepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of\n\nan establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were\n\ngained.\n\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for\n\ntheir consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.\n\nMr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly\n\nfair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\n\ninterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many  years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William  gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\n\n\n\nshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be  highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their\n\nappearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were\n\nproperly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed  hopes of COM ING OUT a year or two sooner than they  might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from\n\ntheir apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte\n\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and  had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general  satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor\n\nagreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her\n\nmust be imaginary. But still he would be her husband.  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage  had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-\n\neducated young women of small fortune, and however\n\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest  preservative from want. This preservative she had now  obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever\n\nbeen handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least\n\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it  must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she  valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would\n\nwonder, and probably would blame her; and though her\n\nresolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by  such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the  information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when\n\nhe returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what\n\nhad passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy\n\n\n\nwas of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept  without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long\n\nabsence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return\n\nas required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same  time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish  his prosperous love.\n\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to\n\nsee any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was  performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.  Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy\n\nthey should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his\n\nengagements might allow him to visit them.\n\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is\n\nparticularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping\n\nto receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail\n\nmyself of it as soon as possible.\"\n\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by\n\nno means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\n\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's\n\ndisapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your\n\nrelations than run the risk of offending your patroness.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins,\" I am particularly\n\nobliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend\n\n\n\nupon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's\n\nconcurrence.\"\n \n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything\n\nrather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be  raised by your coming to us again, which I should think  exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied\n\nthat WE shall take no offence.\"\n \n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited  by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will  speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for\n\nevery other mark of your regard during my stay in\n\nHertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\n\nmy cousin Elizabeth.\"\n\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs.  Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying\n\nhis addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might\n\nhave been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities  much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his  reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so\n\nclever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and\n\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might  become a very agreeable companion. But on the following\n\n\n\nmorning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas  called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with\n\nElizabeth related the event of the day before.\n\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying herself in love\n\nwith her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last\n\nday or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed\n\nalmost as far from possibility as she could encourage him\n\nherself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to\n\novercome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not\n\nhelp crying out:\n\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\"\n\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it\n\nwas no more than she expected, she soon regained her\n\ncomposure, and calmly replied:\n\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you\n\nthink it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure\n\nany woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to\n\nsucceed with you?\"\n\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness\n\nthat the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to\n\nher, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\n\n\n\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte. \"You must\n\nbe surprised, very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins\n\nwas wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to\n\nthink it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have  done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a  comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character,\n\nconnection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\n\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can\n\nboast on entering the marriage state.\"\n\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\" and after an\n\nawkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\n\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before\n\nshe became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a\n\nmatch. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of\n\nmarriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his  being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's  opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she\n\nhad not supposed it to be possible that, when called into\n\naction, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to  worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a  most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend\n\ndisgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the\n\ndistressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to\n\nbe tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\n\n\n\nChapter 23.\n\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was\n\nauthorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself\n\nappeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement\n\nto the family. With many compliments to them, and much  self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the  houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely\n\nwondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more\n\nperseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely  mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,  boisterously exclaimed:\n\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?\n\nDo not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\n\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's\n\ngood breeding carried him through it all; and though he\n\nbegged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information,  he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing\n\ncourtesy.\n\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from\n\nso unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm  his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from  Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the\n\nexclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of\n\n\n\nher congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily  joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\n\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the\n\nexcellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance\n\nof Hunsford from London.\n \nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a\n\ngreat deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he\n\nleft them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first  place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter;  secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken\n\nin; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\n\ntogether; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the\n\nwhole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief;\n\nand the other that she herself had been barbarously misused\n\nby them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt  during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing  could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment.\n\nA week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\n\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to  Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many  months were gone before she could at all forgive their\n\ndaughter.\n\nMr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to\n\n\n\ndiscover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to\n\nthink tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more\n\nfoolish than his daughter!\n\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but\n\nshe said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for\n\ntheir happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider\n\nit as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss\n\nLucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at  Meryton.\n\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being\n\nable to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter  well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than  usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour\n\nlooks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to\n\ndrive happiness away.\n\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint\n\nwhich kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth\n\nfelt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist\n\nbetween them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made  her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude  and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken,\n\nand for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\n\nBingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was\n\nheard of his return.\n\n\n\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear\n\nagain. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived\n\non Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the  solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the  family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience\n\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\n\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the  affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then  explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her\n\nsociety that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish\n\nof seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be  able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he  added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to\n\ntake place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an\n\nunanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an\n\nearly day for making him the happiest of men.\n\nMr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a\n\nmatter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as\n\nmuch disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very  strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas  Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly\n\ntroublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her\n\nhealth was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the  most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.  Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.\n\nBingley's continued absence.\n\n\n\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this\n\nsubject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other\n\ntidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in\n\nMeryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which\n\nshe never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\n \nEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was\n\nindifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping  him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so  destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the\n\nstability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently\n\noccurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and  of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss  Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she\n\nfeared, for the strength of his attachment.\n\nAs for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and\n\nElizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as\n\nno such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed  in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience  for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did\n\nnot come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed\n\nall Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\n\ntranquillity.\n\n\n\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it\n\nhad been on his first introduction. He was too happy,\n\nhowever, to need much attention; and luckily for the others,  the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal  of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at\n\nLucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only\n\nin time to make an apology for his absence before the family\n\nwent to bed.\n \nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very\n\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\n\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of  hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to  her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with\n\njealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them,\n\nshe concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession;  and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was  convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\n\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as\n\nsoon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all\n\nthis to her husband.\n \n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think\n\nthat Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house,\n\nthat I should be forced to make way for HER, and live to see\n\nher take her place in it!\"\n\n\n\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let\n\nus hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\n\nthe survivor.\"\n \nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,\n\ninstead of making any answer, she went on as before.\n\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.\n\nIf it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\n\n\"What should not you mind?\"\n\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\n\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of\n\nsuch insensibility.\"\n\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about  the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail  away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot\n\nunderstand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why\n\nshould HE have it more than anybody else?\"\n\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\n\n\n\nChapter 24.\n\nMiss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all\n\nsettled in London for the winter, and concluded with her\n\nbrother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to\n\nhis friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.\n\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed\n\naffection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss\n\nDarcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing   intimacy,   and   ventured   to   predict   the\n\naccomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her\n\nformer letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her  brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and  mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard\n\nto new furniture.\n \nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against\n\nall others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial\n\nto Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of\n\nJane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much\n\nas she had always been disposed to like him, she could not\n\nthink without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\n\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made\n\n\n\nhim the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice  of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had\n\nhis own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might\n\nhave been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he  thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought  he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\n\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be\n\nunavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet whether  Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by\n\nhis friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's\n\nattachment, or whether it had escaped his observation;\n\nwhatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be  materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation  remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\n\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of\n\nher feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving  them together, after a longer irritation than usual about  Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:\n\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!\n\nShe can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were\n\nbefore.\"\n \nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude,\n\nbut said nothing.\n\n\n\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed,\n\nyou have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most\n\namiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have\n\nnothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him  with. Thank God! I have not THAT pain. A little time,  therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\n\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort\n\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy  on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but  myself.\"\n\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.\n\nYour sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.\"\n\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit,\n\nand threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. YOU wish to think\n\nall the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of\n\nanybody. I only want to think YOU perfect, and you set\n\nyourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any  excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal  good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really\n\nlove, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of\n\nthe world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day  confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human\n\n\n\ncharacters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on  the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two\n\ninstances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's\n\nmarriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is\n\nunaccountable!\"\n \n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.\n\nThey will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance\n\nenough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr.  Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's steady, prudent  character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as\n\nto fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe,\n\nfor everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard\n\nand esteem for our cousin.\"\n \n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but\n\nno one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for\n\nwere I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I  should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of  her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous,\n\nnarrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do;\n\nand you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who  married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall  not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for\n\nthe sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle\n\nand integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that  selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security  for happiness.\"\n\n\n\n\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of\n\nboth,\" replied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by\n\nseeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded\n\nto something else. You mentioned TWO instances. I cannot  misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain  me by thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your\n\nopinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\n\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively  young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is  very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.\n\nWomen fancy admiration means more than it does.\"\n\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\n\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I\n\nhave no idea of there being so much design in the world as\n\nsome persons imagine.\"\n\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's  conduct to design,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to  do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and\n\nthere may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to\n\nother people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the\n\nbusiness.\"\n \n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by\n\nsaying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst\n\nyou can.\"\n\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\n\n\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him?\n\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me,\n\nno other woman can secure it.\"\n \n\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things\n\nbesides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth\n\nand consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has\n\nall the importance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\n\n\"Beyond a doubt, they DO wish him to choose Miss\n\nDarcy,\" replied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings\n\nthan you are supposing. They have known her much longer\n\nthan they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely  they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would\n\nthink herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something\n\nvery objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they  would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting\n\nunnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress\n\nme by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--\n\n\n\nor, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I  should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\n\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\n\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time\n\nMr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between\n\nthem.\n \nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his\n\nreturning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which  Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance  of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter\n\nendeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe\n\nherself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect  of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw  her no more; but though the probability of the statement was\n\nadmitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every\n\nday. Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be\n\ndown again in the summer.\n\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \"So, Lizzy,\" said\n\nhe one day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find. I\n\ncongratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be  crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think  of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her\n\ncompanions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear\n\nto be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are  officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies\n\n\n\nin the country. Let Wickham be YOUR man. He is a pleasant\n\nfellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy\n\nme. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that\n\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an\n\naffectionate mother who will make the most of it.\"\n \nMr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him\n\noften, and to his other recommendations was now added that\n\nof general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had  already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had  suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and\n\npublicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how\n\nmuch they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had\n\nknown anything of the matter.\n\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose\n\nthere might be any extenuating circumstances in the case,\n\nunknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady  candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the  possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was\n\ncondemned as the worst of men.\n\n\n\nChapter 25.\n\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however,\n\nmight be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the\n\nreception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly  after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that  was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his\n\nrelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before;\n\nwished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and\n\npromised their father another letter of thanks.\n\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\n\nreceiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to\n\nspend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a  sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as  well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would\n\nhave had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade,\n\nand within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\n\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several  years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an\n\namiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite\n\nwith all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and  herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They  had frequently been staying with her in town.\n\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival\n\nwas to distribute her presents and describe the newest fash\n\n\n\nions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It  became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to\n\nrelate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-\n\nused since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been  upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in\n\nit.\n \n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have\n\ngot Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very  hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by  this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made\n\nher an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The\n\nconsequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter  married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as  much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people\n\nindeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to\n\nsay it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and  poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have  neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.\n\nHowever, your coming just at this time is the greatest of\n\ncomforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long\n\nsleeves.\"\n \nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been\n\ngiven before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's\n\ncorrespondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and,\n\nin compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.\n\n\n\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\n\nJane,\" said she. \"I am sorry it went off. But these things\n\nhappen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr.  Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few  weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\n\nher, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\"\n\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but  it will not do for US. We do not suffer by ACCIDENT. It  does not often happen that the interference of friends will\n\npersuade a young man of independent fortune to think no\n\nmore of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few\n\ndays before.\"\n\n\"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed,\n\nso doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is\n\nas often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's  acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how  VIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley's love?\"\n\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing\n\nquite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.  Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At  his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not\n\nasking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself,\n\nwithout receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms?\n\nIs not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to\n\nhave felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her\n\ndisposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better\n\nhave happened to YOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed  yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be  prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be\n\nof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as\n\nuseful as anything.\"\n\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and\n\nfelt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.\n\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with\n\nregard to this young man will influence her. We live in so  different a part of town, all our connections are so different,  and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very\n\nimprobable that they should meet at all, unless he really\n\ncomes to see her.\"\n \n\"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the\n\ncustody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer\n\nhim to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt,\n\nhow could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have  HEARD of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would  hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from\n\nits impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it,\n\nMr. Bingley never stirs without him.\"\n\n\n\n\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But\n\ndoes not Jane correspond with his sister? SHE will not be able\n\nto help calling.\"\n\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\n\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of\n\nBingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a\n\nsolicitude on the subject which convinced her, on  examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It  was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his\n\naffection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends\n\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's\n\nattractions.\n \nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure;\n\nand the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the\n\nsame time, than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the  same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a  morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.\n\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with\n\nthe Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a  day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully  provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that\n\nthey did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the\n\nengagement was for home, some of the officers always made  part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one;\n\n\n\nand on these occasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by  Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them\n\nboth. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very\n\nseriously in love, their preference of each other was plain  enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak  to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and\n\nrepresent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an\n\nattachment.\n \nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a\n\ndozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a\n\nconsiderable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he  belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in  common; and though Wickham had been little there since the\n\ndeath of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her\n\nfresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in\n\nthe way of procuring.\n\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.\n\nDarcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an\n\ninexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her  recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which  Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on\n\nthe character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him\n\nand herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr.  Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that  gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might\n\n\n\nagree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected  having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a\n\nvery proud, ill-natured boy.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 26.\n\nMrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus\n\nwent on:\n \n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely  because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not  afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on\n\nyour guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve\n\nhim in an affection which the want of fortune would make so\n\nvery imprudent. I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a  most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\n\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it\n\nis, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have  sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would  depend on YOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.\n\nYou must not disappoint your father.\"\n\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take\n\ncare of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in\n\nlove with me, if I can prevent it.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\n\n\n\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in\n\nlove with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is,\n\nbeyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--\n\nand if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be  better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh!  THAT abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me\n\ndoes me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to\n\nforfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In  short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of  making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that\n\nwhere there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by\n\nimmediate want of fortune from entering into engagements  with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many  of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to\n\nknow that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise\n\nyou, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry  to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with  him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming\n\nhere so very often. At least, you should not REMIND you\n\nmother of inviting him.\"\n\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious\n\nsmile: \"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.\n\nBut do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant\n\n\n\ncompany for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I  will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope\n\nyou are satisfied.\"\n\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point,\n\nwithout being resented.\n\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had\n\nbeen quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his  abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great\n\ninconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast\n\napproaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think  it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone,  that she \"WISHED they might be happy.\" Thursday was to be\n\nthe wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her\n\nfarewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth,\n\nashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good  wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of\n\nthe room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:\n\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\n\n\"THAT you certainly shall.\"\n\n\"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and\n\nsee me?\"\n\n\n\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\n\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,\n\ntherefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\n\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little\n\npleasure in the visit.\n\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added\n\nCharlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\n\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\n\nThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to\n\nsay, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard\n\nfrom her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and  frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally  unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her\n\nwithout feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and\n\nthough determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was\n\nfor the sake of what had been, rather than what was.\n\nCharlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of\n\neagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she\n\nwould speak of her new home, how she would like Lady  Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself  to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that\n\nCharlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she\n\nmight have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed  surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she\n\n\n\ncould not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and  roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour\n\nwas most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of\n\nHunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know\n\nthe rest.\n \nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to\n\nannounce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote\n\nagain, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say\n\nsomething of the Bingleys.\n\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded\n\nas impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town  without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted  for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend\n\nfrom Longbourn had by some accident been lost.\n\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that\n\npart of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in\n\nGrosvenor Street.\"\n \nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen\n\nMiss Bingley. \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words, \"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right,\n\ntherefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after\n\ntheir brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged  with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\n\n\n\nMiss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.\n\nI dare say I shall see them soon here.\"\n\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her\n\nthat accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's\n\nbeing in town.\n\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.\n\nShe endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.  After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and\n\ninventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did\n\nat last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the\n\nalteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself\n\nno longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her\n\nsister will prove what she felt.\n\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of  triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I  confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss\n\nBingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event\n\nhas proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert  that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was  as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her\n\nreason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same\n\ncircumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be  deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\n\n\n\nand not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When\n\nshe did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in\n\nit; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,\n\nsaid not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every  respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was  perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I\n\npity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in\n\nsingling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance  to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she  must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\n\nvery sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need\n\nnot explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety  to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account  for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his\n\nsister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural\n\nand amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any\n\nsuch fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we\n\nmust have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am\n\ncertain, from something she said herself; and yet it would\n\nseem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade  herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot  understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\n\nbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of\n\nduplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every  painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy-your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle\n\nand aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said\n\nsomething of his never returning to Netherfield again, of\n\n\n\ngiving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better  not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such\n\npleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see\n\nthem, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very\n\ncomfortable there.--Yours, etc.\"\n \nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits\n\nreturned as she considered that Jane would no longer be\n\nduped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother  was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a  renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review\n\nof it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\n\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon  marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would  make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.\n\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her\n\npromise concerning that gentleman, and required information;  and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give  contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality\n\nhad subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of\n\nsome one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but  she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her  heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was\n\nsatisfied with believing that SHE would have been his only\n\nchoice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten  thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young  lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but\n\n\n\nElizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in  Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of\n\nindependence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more\n\nnatural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few  struggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and  desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\n\nhappy.\n\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: \"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love;\n\nfor had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I\n\nshould at present detest his very name, and wish him all  manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards  HIM; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot\n\nfind out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling\n\nto think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in  all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I  certainly should be a more interesting object to all my\n\nacquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot\n\nsay that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance  may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take  his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in\n\nthe ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying\n\nconviction that handsome young men must have something to\n\nlive on as well as the plain.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 27.\n\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to  Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January\n\nand February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to\n\nHunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with\n\ngreater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had\n\nincreased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened  her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme,  and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters,\n\nhome could not be faultless, a little change was not\n\nunwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover  give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near,  she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,\n\nhowever, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according\n\nto Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William  and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a  night in London was added in time, and the plan became\n\nperfect as plan could be.\n\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and\n\nalmost promised to answer her letter.\n\n\n\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was\n\nperfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit\n\ncould not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to\n\nexcite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to\n\npity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her  adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\n\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting\n\ntheir opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would  always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she  felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard;\n\nand she parted from him convinced that, whether married or\n\nsingle, he must always be her model of the amiable and\n\npleasing.\n\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to\n\nmake her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his\n\ndaughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed  as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing,  and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of\n\nthe chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir\n\nWilliam's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities\n\nwere worn out, like his information.\n \nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began\n\nit so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they  drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room  window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage\n\n\n\nshe was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking  earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely\n\nas ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\n\nwhose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not  allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness,  as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their\n\ncoming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most\n\npleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the\n\nevening at one of the theatres.\n\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first\n\nobject was her sister; and she was more grieved than\n\nastonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that  though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were  periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that\n\nthey would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\n\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street,  and repeated conversations occurring at different times  between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had,\n\nfrom her heart, given up the acquaintance.\n\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's\n\ndesertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.\n\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is\n\nMiss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\n\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\n\naffairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?\n\n\n\nWhere does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be\n\nimprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with\n\nonly ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\n\nmercenary.\"\n\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I\n\nshall know what to think.\"\n \n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm\n\nof her.\"\n \n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her\n\ngrandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune.\"\n\n\"No--what should he? If it were not allowable for him to\n\ngain MY affections because I had no money, what occasion  could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care\n\nabout, and who was equally poor?\"\n\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\n\ntowards her so soon after this event.\"\n \n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all\n\nthose elegant decorums which other people may observe. If\n\nSHE does not object to it, why should WE?\"\n\n\"HER not objecting does not justify HIM. It only shows\n\nher being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose. HE shall\n\nbe mercenary, and SHE shall be foolish.\"\n\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose. I should be\n\nsorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so\n\nlong in Derbyshire.\"\n\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men\n\nwho live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\n\nHertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all.\n\nThank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither\n\nmanner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only\n\nones worth knowing, after all.\"\n\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\n\ndisappointment.\"\n\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play,\n\nshe had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to  accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which  they proposed taking in the summer.\n\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said\n\nMrs. Gardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\n\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and\n\ngrateful.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what\n\ndelight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.\n\nAdieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to\n\nrocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall  spend! And when we DO return, it shall not be like other  travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of\n\nanything. We WILL know where we have gone--we WILL\n\nrecollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers\n\nshall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when  we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin\n\nquarreling about its relative situation. Let OUR first effusions\n\nbe less insupportable than those of the generality of\n\ntravellers.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 28.\n\nEvery object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to\n\nbanish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern\n\ntour was a constant source of delight.\n\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning\n\nexpected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was\n\ntheir boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the\n\nrecollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\n \nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden\n\nsloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales,\n\nand the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving.  Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the  carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel\n\nwalk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole\n\nparty. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at  the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with  the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more\n\nsatisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately\n\nreceived. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not  altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it  had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear\n\nand satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then,\n\nwith no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the\n\n\n\nentrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the  parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\n\nformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his\n\nwife's offers of refreshment.\n \nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good\n\nproportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he\n\naddressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make  her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though  everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\n\ngratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with\n\nwonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air\n\nwith such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of  which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly\n\nwas not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\n\nCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in\n\ngeneral Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long  enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from\n\nthe sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their\n\njourney, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins  invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large\n\nand well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended\n\nhimself. To work in this garden was one of his most\n\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\n\ncountenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness\n\nof the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as\n\npossible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross\n\n\n\nwalk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the  praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a\n\nminuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could\n\nnumber the fields in every direction, and could tell how many  tress there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views  which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could\n\nboast, none were to be compared with the prospect of\n\nRosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\n\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round\n\nhis two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to\n\nencounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while\n\nSir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and\n\nfriend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to\n\nhave the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help.\n\nIt was rather small, but well built and convenient; and\n\neverything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and\n\nconsistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.\n\nWhen Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\n\nforgotten.\n\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed:\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing\n\nLady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church,\n\nand I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all\n\naffability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be  honoured with some portion of her notice when service is  over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include\n\nyou and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\n\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear  Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week,  and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage\n\nis regularly ordered for us. I SHOULD say, one of her\n\nladyship's carriages, for she has several.\"\n\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman\n\nindeed,\" added Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\n\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the\n\nsort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much\n\ndeference.\"\n \nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over\n\nHertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been\n\nwritten; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her\n\nchamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of  contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and\n\ncomposure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge\n\nthat it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how  her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual\n\n\n\nemployments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and  the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively\n\nimagination soon settled it all.\n\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a\n\nmoment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent\n\nhurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and  met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation,\n\ncried out-\n \n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\n\ndining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell\n\nyou what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\n\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her\n\nnothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which\n\nfronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies\n\nstopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.\n\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that\n\nthe pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but\n\nLady Catherine and her daughter.\"\n\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it\n\nis not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who\n\nlives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at\n\n\n\nher. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought\n\nthat she could be so thin and small?\"\n \n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in\n\nall this wind. Why does she not come in?\"\n\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest\n\nof favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\n\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other\n\nideas. \"She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him\n\nvery well. She will make him a very proper wife.\"\n\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\n\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's\n\nhigh diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest  contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly  bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\n\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies\n\ndrove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins\n\nno sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate  them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by\n\nletting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at\n\nRosings the next day.\n\n\n\nChapter 29.\n\nMr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see\n\nher civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he\n\nhad wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be  given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's  condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\n\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all\n\nsurprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea  and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my  knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who\n\ncould have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have\n\nimagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an  invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so  immediately after your arrival!\"\n\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir\n\nWilliam, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding\n\nare not uncommon.\"\n \nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of\n\n\n\nsuch rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might\n\nnot wholly overpower them.\n\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\n\nElizabeth-\n \n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\n\napparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\n\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would\n\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is  superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being\n\nsimply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\n\npreserved.\"\n\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\n\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her\n\ndinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her  manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been  little used to company, and she looked forward to her\n\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her\n\nfather had done to his presentation at St. James's.\n\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its\n\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\n\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the  scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his\n\n\n\nenumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his\n\nrelation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir\n\nLewis de Bourgh.\n\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She\n\nhad heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful\n\nfrom any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the  mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could  witness without trepidation.\n\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out,\n\nwith a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished  ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter,\n\nand Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great\n\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\n\nsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction\n\nshould be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without\n\nany of those apologies and thanks which he would have\n\nthought necessary.\n\nIn spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he\n\nhad but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take\n\nhis seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened  almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not\n\n\n\nknowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite  equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before\n\nher composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with\n\nstrongly-marked features, which might once have been  handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner  of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their\n\ninferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but\n\nwhatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as  marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham  immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of\n\nthe day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly\n\nwhat he represented.\n\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr.\n\nDarcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost\n\nhave joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and  so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness  between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\n\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke\n\nvery little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose  appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was  entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a\n\nscreen in the proper direction before her eyes.\n\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\n\n\n\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing\n\nthem that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\n\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all\n\nthe servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had  promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at  the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as\n\nif he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,\n\nand ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish  was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who  was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\n\nsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine\n\ncould bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their  excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles,  especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to\n\nthem. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\n\nwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she  was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former  of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the\n\nlatter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson\n\nwas chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh  ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was  indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and\n\nthe gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\n\n\n\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved  that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She\n\ninquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and\n\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the  management of them all; told her how everything ought to be  regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to\n\nthe care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that\n\nnothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could  furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the\n\nintervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a\n\nvariety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to\n\nthe latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who\n\nshe observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind  of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she\n\nhad, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether\n\nany of them were likely to be married, whether they were  handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her  father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?\n\nElizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but\n\nanswered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\n\nobserved,\n \n\"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For\n\nyour sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but\n\notherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the  female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de  Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\n\n\n\n\"A little.\"\n \n\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear\n\nyou. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to---\n\nYou shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\n\n\"One of them does.\"\n \n\"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned.\n\nThe Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an\n\nincome as yours. Do you draw?\"\n\n\"No, not at all.\"\n \n\"What, none of you?\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n \n\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no  opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town  every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\n\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father\n\nhates London.\"\n \n\"Has your governess left you?\"\n\n\"We never had any governess.\"\n\n\n\n\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters\n\nbrought up at home without a governess! I never heard of\n\nsuch a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to\n\nyour education.\"\n\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that\n\nhad not been the case.\n \n\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a\n\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.\"\n\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but\n\nsuch of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We\n\nwere always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that\n\nwere necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\n\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent,\n\nand if I had known your mother, I should have advised her\n\nmost strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is\n\nto be done in education without steady and regular instruction,  and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how  many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.\n\nI am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four\n\nnieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated  through my means; and it was but the other day that I  recommended another young person, who was merely\n\naccidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\n\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady  Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope\n\n\n\na treasure. 'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a\n\ntreasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, all.\"\n\n\"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only  the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are  married! Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\n\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps SHE is full\n\nyoung to be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it  would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not  have their share of society and amusement, because the elder\n\nmay not have the means or inclination to marry early. The\n\nlast-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the  first. And to be kept back on SUCH a motive! I think it would  not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of\n\nmind.\"\n \n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your  opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is  your age?\"\n\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth,\n\nsmiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\n\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first\n\n\n\ncreature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified\n\nimpertinence.\n\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you\n\nneed not conceal your age.\"\n\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\n\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over,\n\nthe card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and\n\nMr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de  Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table\n\nwas superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that\n\ndid not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson  expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too  cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more\n\npassed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally\n\nspeaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating  some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in  agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for\n\nevery fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too\n\nmany. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his\n\nmemory with anecdotes and noble names.\n\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long\n\nas they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was\n\noffered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately  ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady\n\n\n\nCatherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\n\narrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness\n\non Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they  departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth  was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she\n\nhad seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made\n\nmore favourable than it really was. But her commendation,  though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy  Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her\n\nladyship's praise into his own hands.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 30.\n\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\n\nsuch a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir\n\nWilliam was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual\n\nemployments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did\n\nnot see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of  the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him  either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and\n\nlooking out of the window in his own book-room, which\n\nfronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was\n\nbackwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that\n\nCharlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common\n\nuse; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant\n\naspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent  reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly  have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one\n\nequally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the\n\narrangement.\n \nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge\n\nof what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss\n\nde Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed\n\n\n\ncoming to inform them of, though it happened almost every  day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a\n\nfew minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely\n\never prevailed upon to get out.\n\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\n\nRosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\n\nnecessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that\n\nthere might be other family livings to be disposed of, she  could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and  then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and\n\nnothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room\n\nduring these visits. She examined into their employments,  looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently;  found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected\n\nthe housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any\n\nrefreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out  that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her  family.\n\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was\n\nnot in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most  active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of  which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any\n\nof the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome,\n\ndiscontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to  settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold  them into harmony and plenty.\n\n\n\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and\n\nthere being only one card-table in the evening, every such\n\nentertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other  engagements were few, as the style of living in the  neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach.\n\nThis, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole\n\nshe spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours  of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was  so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment\n\nout of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently\n\nwent while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was  along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where  there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value\n\nbut herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady\n\nCatherine's curiosity.\n\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was\n\nto bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so\n\nsmall a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon  after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the  course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her\n\nacquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\n\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings  parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss  Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin,\n\nfor whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who\n\n\n\ntalked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of  him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost\n\nangry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss\n\nLucas and herself.\n \nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr.\n\nCollins was walking the whole morning within view of the\n\nlodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the\n\nearliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the  carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great  intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to\n\nRosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady\n\nCatherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord  ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr.\n\nCollins returned, the gentleman accompanied him. Charlotte\n\nhad seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road,  and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an  honour they might expect, adding:\n\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr.\n\nDarcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\n\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the\n\ndoorbell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered\n\nthe room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about  thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the\n\n\n\ngentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look  in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\n\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings\n\ntoward her friend, met her with every appearance of  composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying\n\na word.\n \nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with\n\nthe readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very  pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight  observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for\n\nsome time without speaking to anybody. At length, however,\n\nhis civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth  after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual  way, and after a moment's pause, added:\n\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.\n\nHave you never happened to see her there?\"\n\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of\n\nwhat had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she\n\nthought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had  never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject  was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards\n\nwent away.\n\n\n\nChapter 31.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.\n\nIt was some days, however, before they received any\n\ninvitation thither-for while there were visitors in the house,\n\nthey could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,  almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were\n\nhonoured by such an attention, and then they were merely\n\nasked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the  last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her  daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage\n\nmore than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen\n\nonly at church.\n\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her\n\nladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their\n\ncompany was by no means so acceptable as when she could  get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her  nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more\n\nthan to any other person in the room.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.  Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very\n\nmuch. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably\n\nof Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home,\n\n\n\nof new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\n\nwell enter tained in that room before; and they conversed with\n\nso much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady\n\nCatherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the\n\nfeeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\n\nscruple to call out:\n\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you\n\nare talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear\n\nwhat it is.\"\n \n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no\n\nlonger able to avoid a reply.\n\n\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my\n\ndelight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are\n\nspeaking of music. There are few people in England, I  suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than  myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should\n\nhave been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\n\nhad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\n\nperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\n\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's\n\nproficiency.\n\n\n\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said\n\nLady Catherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot\n\nexpect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\n\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need\n\nsuch advice. She practises very constantly.\"\n\n\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when\n\nI next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\n\naccount. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music  is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss  Bennet several times, that she will never play really well\n\nunless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no\n\ninstrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to  come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.  Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know,\n\nin that part of the house.\"\n\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-\n\nbreeding, and made no answer.\n\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded\n\nElizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down\n\ndirectly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady  Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to  her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and\n\nmaking with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte\n\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair\n\nperformer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing,\n\n\n\nand at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch\n\nsmile, and said:\n \n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all\n\nthis state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister  DOES play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that  never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My\n\ncourage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.\"\n\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because  you could not really believe me to entertain any design of  alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your\n\nacquaintance long enough to know that you find great\n\nenjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact\n\nare not your own.\"\n\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and\n\nsaid to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very\n\npretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.  I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to  expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had\n\nhoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed,\n\nMr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to\n\nretaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your\n\nrelations to hear.\"\n \n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\n\n\n\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves\n\namong strangers.\"\n\n\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something  very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in  Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball,\n\nwhat do you think he did? He danced only four dances,\n\nthough gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a  partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\n\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in\n\nthe assembly beyond my own party.\"\n\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.\n\nWell, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers\n\nwait your orders.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I  sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend  myself to strangers.\"\n\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said\n\nElizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\n\n\n\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without\n\napplying to him. It is because he will not give himself the\n\ntrouble.\"\n \n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people\n\npossess,\" said Darcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have\n\nnever seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or\n\nappear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.\"\n\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this  instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many  women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do\n\nnot produce the same expression. But then I have always\n\nsupposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the  trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe MY fingers  as capable as any other woman's of superior execution.\"\n\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have\n\nemployed your time much better. No one admitted to the  privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We  neither of us perform to strangers.\"\n\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called\n\nout to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately  began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after  listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:\n\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised\n\nmore, and could have the advantage of a London master. She\n\n\n\nhas a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not  equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful\n\nperformer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\n\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the\n\nwhole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this\n\ncomfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as\n\nlikely to marry HER, had she been his relation.\n\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's\n\nperformance, mixing with them many instructions on\n\nexecution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the\n\nforbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen,  remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was\n\nready to take them all home.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 32.\n\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at\n\nthe door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no\n\ncarriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and  under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished  letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when\n\nthe door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy,\n\nand Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\n\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had\n\nunderstood all the ladies were to be within.\n \nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something,\n\nand in this emergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him\n\nlast in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he  would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she\n\nobserved:\n \n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last\n\nNovember, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if  I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters\n\nwere well, I hope, when you left London?\"\n\n\n\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\n\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and,\n\nafter a short pause added:\n\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much\n\nidea of ever returning to Netherfield again?\"\n\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he\n\nmay spend very little of his time there in the future. He has\n\nmany friends, and is at a time of life when friends and\n\nengagements are continually increasing.\"\n\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be\n\nbetter for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place\n\nentirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.  But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for  the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we\n\nmust expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give\n\nit up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\n\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking\n\nlonger of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now\n\ndetermined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\n\n\n\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal\n\nto it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\n \n\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have\n\nbestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.\"\n\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\n\nwife.\"\n \n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having  met with one of the very few sensible women who would  have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My\n\nfriend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain\n\nthat I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing  she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a  prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\n\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so\n\neasy a distance of her own family and friends.\"\n\n\"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\n\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than\n\nhalf a day's journey. Yes, I call it a VERY easy distance.\"\n\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the\n\nADVANTAGES of the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should\n\nnever have said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\n\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I\n\nsuppose, would appear far.\"\n\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she\n\nanswered:\n \n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too  near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and  depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is\n\nfortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant,\n\ndistance becomes no evil. But that is not the case HERE. Mr.\n\nand Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a\n\none as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded\n\nmy friend would not call herself NEAR her family under less\n\nthan HALF the present distance.\"\n\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,\n\n\"YOU cannot have a right to such very strong local\n\nattachment. YOU cannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\n\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a\n\ncolder voice:\n \n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\n\n\n\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the\n\nentrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her\n\nwalk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the  mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet,  and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to\n\nanybody, went away.\n\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon  as he was gone. \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you,  or he would never have called us in this familiar way.\"\n\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very\n\nlikely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after  various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to  proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which\n\nwas the more probable from the time of year. All field sports\n\nwere over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and  a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors;  and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of\n\nthe walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins\n\nfound a temptation from this period of walking thither almost  every day. They called at various times of the morning,  sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then\n\naccompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\n\n\n\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of  her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in\n\ncomparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness\n\nin Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have\n\nthe best informed mind.\n \nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was\n\nmore difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he\n\nfrequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his  lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity  rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to\n\nhimself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins\n\nknew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's\n\noccasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was  generally different, which her own knowledge of him could\n\nnot have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this\n\nchange the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend  Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She  watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever\n\nhe came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly\n\nlooked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that  look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she\n\noften doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and\n\nsometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. She had\n\nonce or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his  being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;  and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject,\n\nfrom the danger of raising expectations which might only end\n\n\n\nin disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a\n\ndoubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could\n\nsuppose him to be in her power.\n\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her,\n\nand his situation in life was most eligible; but, to\n\ncounterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable  patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 33\n\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was\n\nbrought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to\n\ninform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it\n\ncould occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did,\n\nand even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a\n\nvoluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a\n\nfew formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,  but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk  with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself\n\nthe trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in\n\nthe course of their third rencontre that he was asking some\n\nodd  unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at  Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.\n\nand Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings\n\nand her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to  expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be  staying THERE too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he\n\nhave Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he\n\nmeant anything, he must mean and allusion to what might  arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite  glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the\n\nParsonage.\n\n\n\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that\n\nJane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again\n\nsurprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel  Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter  immediately and forcing a smile, she said:\n\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\n\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I  generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at  the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\"\n\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\n\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\n\nParsonage together.\n\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his\n\ndisposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\n\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he\n\nhas at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not\n\nknow anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing\n\nwhat he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\n\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel\n\nFitzwilliam. \"But so we all do. It is only that he has better\n\nmeans of having it than many others, because he is rich, and\n\nmany others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you\n\nknow, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very\n\nlittle of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of\n\nself-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented  by want of money from going wherever you chose, or  procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\n\n\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I\n\nhave experienced many hardships of that nature. But in  matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.  Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\"\n\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think\n\nthey very often do.\"\n\n\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there\n\nare too many in my rank of life who can afford to marry\n\nwithout some attention to money.\"\n\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she  coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively  tone, \"And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger\n\nson? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you\n\nwould not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\n\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy\n\nher affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:\n\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly  for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he  does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.\n\nBut, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as\n\nshe is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage\n\nwhich he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the\n\nguardian ship of Miss Darcy.\"\n\n\"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you  make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young  ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage,\n\nand if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her\n\nown way.\"\n\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she\n\nsupposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness,\n\nconvinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near\n\nthe truth. She directly replied:\n\n\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of\n\nher; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in\n\nthe world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of\n\n\n\nmy acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have\n\nheard you say that you know them.\"\n\n\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant\n\ngentlemanlike man--he is a great friend of Darcy's.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is\n\nuncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal\n\nof care of him.\"\n \n\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care  of him in those points where he most wants care. From  something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason\n\nto think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to\n\nbeg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley\n\nwas the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\n\n\"What is it you mean?\"\n\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be\n\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's\n\nfamily, it would be an unpleasant thing.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\n\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing\n\nit to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he  congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the  inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without\n\n\n\nmentioning names or any other particulars, and I only  suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of\n\nyoung man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing\n\nthem to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\n\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections\n\nagainst the lady.\"\n\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\n\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam,\n\nsmiling. \"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\n\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart\n\nswelling with indignation. After watching her a little,\n\nFitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.\n\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she.\n\n\"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he\n\nto be the judge?\"\n\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\n\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the\n\npropriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own\n\njudgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what  manner his friend was to be happy. But,\" she continued,\n\n\n\nrecollecting herself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is  not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there\n\nwas much affection in the case.\"\n \n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it\n\nis a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very\n\nsadly.\"\n\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a\n\npicture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an  answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation  talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parson-\n\nage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor\n\nleft them, she could think without interruption of all that she  had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people\n\ncould be meant than those with whom she was connected.\n\nThere could not exist in the world TWO men over whom Mr.\n\nDarcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss\n\nBingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his\n\nown vanity, however, did not mislead him, HE was the cause,  his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\n\nsuffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\n\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate,\n\ngenerous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting\n\nan evil he might have inflicted.\n\n\n\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\"\n\nwere Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections\n\nprobably were, her having one uncle who was a country\n\nattorney, and another who was in business in London.\n\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no\n\npossibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!-\n\n-her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her\n\nmanners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against  my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities  Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which\n\nhe will probably never each.\" When she thought of her\n\nmother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not  allow that any objections THERE had material weight with  Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a\n\ndeeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's\n\nconnections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite  decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst  kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley\n\nfor his sister.\n \nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr.\n\nDarcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings,\n\nwhere they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing  that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much  as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr.\n\n\n\nCollins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady\n\nCatherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 34.\n\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters\n\nwhich Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They\n\ncontained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of  past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want\n\nof that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her\n\nstyle, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at  ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had  been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence\n\nconveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it\n\nhad hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful  boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a  keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation\n\nto think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after\n\nthe next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she  should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to  the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.\n\nShe could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without\n\nremembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel\n\nFitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all,\n\nand agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy\n\nabout him.\n\n\n\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by\n\nthe idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had\n\nonce before called late in the evening, and might now come to  inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished,  and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her\n\nutter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an\n\nhurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her  health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were  better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a\n\nfew moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\n\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:\n\n\"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will\n\nnot be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently\n\nI admire and love you.\"\n\nElizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She\n\nstared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered\n\nsufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt,  and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke  well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be\n\ndetailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\n\ntenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of its  being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always  opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which\n\n\n\nseemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was\n\nvery unlikely to recommend his suit.\n\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be\n\ninsensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and  though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at  first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to\n\nresentment by his subsequent language, she lost all\n\ncompassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself  to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He  concluded with representing to her the strength of that\n\nattachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found\n\nimpossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it  would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he  said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\n\nfavourable answer. He SPOKE of apprehension and anxiety,\n\nbut his countenance expressed real security. Such a  circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he\n\nceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:\n \n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode\n\nto express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,  however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that  obligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I\n\nwould now thank you. But I cannot--I have never desired your\n\ngood opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most  unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It  has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will\n\n\n\nbe of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have  long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have\n\nlittle difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.\"\n\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale\n\nwith anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in\n\nevery feature. He was struggling for the appearance of  composure, and would not open his lips till he believed  himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's\n\nfeelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness,\n\nhe said:\n \n\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of\n\nexpecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\n\nlittle ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of\n\nsmall importance.\"\n\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident\n\na desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me\n\nthat you liked me against your will, against your reason, and\n\neven against your character? Was not this some excuse for  incivility, if I WAS uncivil? But I have other provocations.  You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you-\n\nhad they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable,\n\ndo you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\n\n\n\nthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever,\n\nthe happiness of a most beloved sister?\"\n\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed\n\ncolour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without\n\nattempting to interrupt her while she continued:\n\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No\n\nmotive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted\n\nTHERE. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the world for\n\ncaprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\n\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the\n\nacutest kind.\"\n \nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\n\nlistening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by\n\nany feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of\n\naffected incredulity.\n\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\n\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish\n\nof denying that I did everything in my power to separate my  friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.  Towards HIM I have been kinder than towards myself.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\n\nconciliate her.\n \n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which  my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my  opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in\n\nthe recital which I received many months ago from Mr.\n\nWickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon\n\nothers?\"\n \n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\"\n\nsaid Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened\n\ncolour.\n \n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help\n\nfeeling an interest in him?\"\n\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes,\n\nhis misfortunes have been great indeed.\"\n\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy.\n\n\"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty-comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages  which you must know to have been designed for him. You\n\nhave deprived the best years of his life of that independence\n\nwhich was no less his due than his desert. You have done all\n\n\n\nthis! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with\n\ncontempt and ridicule.\"\n\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps\n\nacross the room, \"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation  in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But\n\nperhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards\n\nher, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your  pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that  had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\n\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with\n\ngreater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into  the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed  inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But\n\ndisguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of\n\nthe feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you  expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to  congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition\n\nin life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\n\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she\n\nsaid:\n \n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the\n\nmode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than\n\n\n\nas it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing\n\nyou, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\n\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she\n\ncontinued:\n \n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any\n\npossible way that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\n\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her\n\nwith an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.\n\nShe went on:\n \n\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may\n\nalmost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners,\n\nimpressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your  conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others,  were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on\n\nwhich succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike;\n\nand I had not known you a month before I felt that you were  the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on  to marry.\"\n\n\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly\n\ncomprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed  of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up  so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your\n\nhealth and happiness.\"\n\n\n\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and\n\nElizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and\n\nquit the house.\n\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness\n\nsat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she\n\nreflected on what had passed, was increased by every review\n\nof it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr.  Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many  months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all\n\nthe objections which had made him prevent his friend's\n\nmarrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal  force in his own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying  to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his\n\npride, his abominable pride--his shameless avowal of what he\n\nhad done with respect to Jane--his unpardonable assurance in  acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the  unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham,\n\nhis cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\n\novercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment  had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated  reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made\n\nher feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's\n\nobservation, and hurried her away to her room.\n\n\n\nChapter 35.\n\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened;\n\nit was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally\n\nindisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast,  to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding  directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.\n\nDarcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of\n\nentering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther  from the turn-pike-road. The park paling was still the  boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates\n\ninto the ground.\n\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which\n\nshe had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the\n\ncountry, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early  trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she  caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\n\nwhich edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of\n\nits being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the  person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and  stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She\n\nhad turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a\n\nvoice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\n\n\n\ntowards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and,  holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a\n\nlook of haughty composure, \"I have been walking in the grove\n\nsome time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the  honour of reading that letter?\" And then, with a slight bow,  turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\n\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest\n\ncuriosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still  increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two  sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close\n\nhand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way\n\nalong the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings,\n\nat eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-\n\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\n\napprehension of its containing any repetition of those\n\nsentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so  disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining  you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for\n\nthe happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\n\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must  occasion, should have been spared, had not my character  required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon\n\nthe freedom with which I demand your attention; your\n\nfeelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of\n\nyour justice.\n\n\n\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means\n\nof equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first\n\nmentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I\n\nhad detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that\n\nI had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\n\nhumanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\n\nprospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have\n\nthrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged  favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any  other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been\n\nbrought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to\n\nwhich the separation of two young persons, whose affection  could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no  comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was\n\nlast night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance,\n\nI shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under\n\nthe necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to\n\nyours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be\n\nobeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\n\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in\n\ncommon with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister\n\nto any other young woman in the country. But it was not till  the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any  apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often\n\nseen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of\n\n\n\ndancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William  Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to\n\nyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their\n\nmarriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time  alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my  friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that\n\nhis partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever\n\nwitnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and\n\nmanners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but  without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained\n\nconvinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she\n\nreceived his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them  by any participation of sentiment. If YOU have not been  mistaken here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior\n\nknowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it\n\nbe so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on  her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall  not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's\n\ncountenance and air was such as might have given the most\n\nacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper,  her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was  desirous of believing her indifferent is certain--but I will\n\nventure to say that my investigation and decisions are not\n\nusually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her  to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial  conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to\n\nthe marriage were not merely those which I last night\n\nacknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put\n\n\n\naside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so  great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other\n\ncauses of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and\n\nexisting to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself  endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately  before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\n\nsituation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was\n\nnothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so  frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your  three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.\n\nPardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your\n\nconcern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your  displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you  consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so\n\nas to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less\n\ngenerally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is  honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only  say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of\n\nall parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened\n\nwhich could have led me before, to preserve my friend from  what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left  Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am\n\ncertain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\n\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters'  uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our  coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike\n\nsensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother,\n\n\n\nwe shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We  accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of\n\npointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\n\ndescribed, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this  remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his  determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\n\nprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the\n\nassurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's\n\nindifference. He had before believed her to return his affection\n\nwith sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\n\nnatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my\n\njudgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that  he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To  persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that\n\nconviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a\n\nmoment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.  There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on\n\nwhich I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\n\ncondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal\n\nfrom him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it  was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet  ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill\n\nconsequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not\n\nappear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without  some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was\n\nbeneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best.\n\nOn this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology\n\nto offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was\n\n\n\nunknowingly done and though the motives which governed  me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\n\nyet learnt to condemn them.\n\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of  having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying  before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of\n\nwhat he has PARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but\n\nof the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one\n\nwitness of undoubted veracity.\n\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who\n\nhad for many years the management of all the Pemberley\n\nestates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust  naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on  George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\n\ntherefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\n\nschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important  assistance, as his own father, always poor from the  extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him\n\na gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this\n\nyoung man's society, whose manner were always engaging; he  had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church  would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As\n\nfor myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think\n\nof him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities-the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the  knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation\n\n\n\nof a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who  had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which\n\nMr. Darcy could not have. Here again shall give you pain--to\n\nwhat degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the  sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of  their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real\n\ncharacter--it adds even another motive.\n \n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his  attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in  his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\n\nadvancement in the best manner that his profession might al-\n\nlow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family  living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was  also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not\n\nlong survive mine, and within half a year from these events,\n\nMr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\n\npecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\n\ncould not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of\n\nstudying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one  thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.\n\nI rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any\n\nrate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that  Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was  therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance in\n\nthe church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation\n\n\n\nto receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought\n\ntoo ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society\n\nin town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying  the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all  restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\n\nabout three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of\n\nthe incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,  he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His  circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in\n\nbelieving it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a\n\nmost unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on  being ordained, if I would present him to the living in  question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he\n\nwas well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and\n\nI could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment\n\nwas in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he\n\nwas doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\n\nreproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of  acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last\n\nsummer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\n\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish\n\nto forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present  should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said\n\nthus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is\n\n\n\nmore than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of  my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About\n\na year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment\n\nformed for her in London; and last summer she went with the\n\nlady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went  Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to\n\nhave been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.\n\nYounge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart\n\nretained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,\n\nthat she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to  consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must  be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to\n\nadd, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them\n\nunexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and  then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and  offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\n\nacknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt\n\nand how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings  prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham,  who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of\n\ncourse removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object\n\nwas unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty  thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of  revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His\n\nrevenge would have been complete indeed.\n\n\n\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\n\nwhich we have been concerned together; and if you do not\n\nabsolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me\n\nhenceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in  what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed  on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.\n\nIgnorant as you previously were of everything concerning\n\neither, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion\n\ncertainly not in your inclination.\n\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you\n\nlast night; but I was not then master enough of myself to\n\nknow what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of  everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the  testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near\n\nrelationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of\n\nthe executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably  acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your  abhorrence of ME should make MY assertions valueless, you\n\ncannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my\n\ncousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting  him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this  letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only\n\nadd, God bless you.\n\n\"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\n\n\n\nChapter 36.\n\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may\n\nwell be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and\n\nwhat a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she  read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she  first understand that he believed any apology to be in his\n\npower; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have\n\nno explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not  conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might  say, she began his account of what had happened at\n\nNetherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her\n\npower of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing  what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of  attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of\n\nher sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and\n\nhis account of the real, the worst objections to the match,  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He  expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her;\n\nhis style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and\n\ninsolence.\n \nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\n\nWickham--when she read with somewhat clearer attention a\n\nrelation of events which, if true, must overthrow every\n\ncherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an\n\n\n\naffinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet  more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\n\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.\n\nShe wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,  \"This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"-and when she had gone through the whole letter,\n\nthough scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put\n\nit hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that\n\nshe would never look in it again.\n\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could\n\nrest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a\n\nminute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as  well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of\n\nall that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as\n\nto examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his\n\nconnection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he  had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,  though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally\n\nwell with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the\n\nother; but when she came to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her  memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible\n\nnot to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\n\nother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her\n\nwishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the\n\nclosest attention, the particulars immediately following of\n\nWickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his\n\n\n\nreceiving in lieu so consider able a sum as three thousand  pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\n\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\n\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement-but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion.  Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the\n\naffair, which she had believed it impossible that any\n\ncontrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's  conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which  must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\n\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he\n\nscrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly  shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its  injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into\n\nthe ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\n\npersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him  accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life nothing had been known in\n\nHertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real\n\ncharacter, had information been in her power, she had never  felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner  had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\n\nShe tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some\n\ndistinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might  rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the  predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under\n\nwhich she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had\n\n\n\ndescribed as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance.\n\nBut no such recollection befriended her. She could see him\n\ninstantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she\n\ncould remember no more substantial good than the general  approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his  social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on\n\nthis point a considerable while, she once more continued to\n\nread. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on  Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had  passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the\n\nmorning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of\n\nevery particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom  she had previously received the information of his near\n\nconcern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had\n\nno reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on\n\napplying to him, but the idea was checked by the  awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly  banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have\n\nhazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of\n\nhis cousin's corroboration.\n \nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\n\nconversation between Wickham and herself, in their first\n\nevening at Mr. Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still\n\nfresh in her memory. She was NOW struck with the  impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and  wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of\n\nputting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency\n\n\n\nof his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he  had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr.\n\nDarcy might leave the country, but that HE should stand his\n\nground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next  week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family  had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\n\nherself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere\n\ndiscussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking  Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect  for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.\n\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he\n\nwas concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the  consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the  mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of\n\nhis wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His\n\nbehaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive;\n\nhe had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had  been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference\n\nwhich she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every\n\nlingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in  farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow Mr.  Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his\n\nblamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were\n\nhis manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\n\nacquaintance-an acquaintance which had latterly brought them  much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways-\n\n-seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust-\n\n\n\n-anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that  among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that\n\neven Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that\n\nshe had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as  to prove him capable of SOME amiable feeling; that had his  actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a\n\nviolation of everything right could hardly have been\n\nconcealed from the world; and that friendship between a  person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley,  was incomprehensible.\n\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy\n\nnor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been\n\nblind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.\n\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have\n\nprided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself\n\non my abilities! who have often disdained the generous  candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or  blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet,\n\nhow just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have\n\nbeen more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been  my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by  the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our\n\nacquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance,\n\nand driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till\n\nthis moment I never knew myself.\"\n\n\n\nFrom herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.\n\nDarcy's explanation THERE had appeared very insufficient,\n\nand she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a  second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his  assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give\n\nin the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of\n\nher sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering  what Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she  deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's\n\nfeelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there\n\nwas a constant complacency in her air and manner not often\n\nunited with great sensibility.\n\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her\n\nfamily were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet\n\nmerited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice  of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the  circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having\n\npassed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\n\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on\n\nhis mind than on hers.\n \nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It\n\nsoothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which\n\nhad thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as  she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the  work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the\n\n\n\ncredit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct,  she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known\n\nbefore.\n \nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way\n\nto   every   variety   of   thought--re-considering   events,  determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as\n\nshe could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue,\n\nand a recollection of her long absence, made her at length\n\nreturn home; and she entered the house with the wish of\n\nappearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing\n\nsuch reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\n \nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from\n\nRosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only\n\nfor a few minutes, to take leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam\n\nhad been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her\n\nreturn, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be  found. Elizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing  him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\n\nlonger an object; she could think only of her letter.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 37.\n\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.  Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing\n\nintelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as\n\ntolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy  scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then  hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on\n\nhis return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message\n\nfrom her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to\n\nmake her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.\n\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without\n\nrecollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time\n\nhave been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she  think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation\n\nwould have been. \"What would she have said? how would she\n\nhave behaved?\" were questions with which she amused\n\nherself.\n \nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.\n\n\"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I\n\nbelieve no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I\n\nam particularly attached to these young men, and know them  to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to  go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits\n\ntolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most\n\n\n\nacutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to\n\nRosings certainly increases.\"\n\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in\n\nhere, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and\n\ndaughter.\n\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet\n\nseemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by\n\nherself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so\n\nsoon, she added:\n \n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and\n\nbeg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very\n\nglad of your company, I am sure.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind\n\ninvitation,\" replied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to\n\naccept it. I must be in town next Saturday.\"\n\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so  before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so\n\nsoon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another\n\nfortnight.\"\n\n\"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my\n\nreturn.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother\n\ncan. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.\n\nAnd if you will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in\n\nmy power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going  there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object  to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of\n\nyou--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I\n\nshould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you\n\nlarge.\"\n\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide\n\nby our original plan.\"\n\nLady Catherine seemed resigned. \"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling\n\npost by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive\n\nto send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to  that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly  guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.\n\nWhen my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I\n\nmade a point of her having two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and  Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a\n\ndifferent manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\n\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.  Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would  really be discreditable to YOU to let them go alone.\"\n\n\n\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\n\n\"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am\n\nvery glad you have somebody who thinks of these things.\n\nWhere shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\n\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting\n\ntheir journey, and as she did not answer them all herself,\n\nattention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky  for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten  where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours;\n\nwhenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest\n\nrelief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which  she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\n\nrecollections.\n \nMr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing\n\nby heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards  its writer were at times widely different. When she  remembered the style of his address, she was still full of\n\nindignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had\n\ncondemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against  herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of  compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general\n\ncharacter respect; but she could not approve him; nor could\n\nshe for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest  inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour,\n\n\n\nthere was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the  unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier\n\nchagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented\n\nwith laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain  the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother,  with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible\n\nof the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an\n\nendeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;  but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,  what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine,\n\nweak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's\n\nguidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and  Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a  hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was\n\nan officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\n\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.\n\nAnxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern;\n\nand Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her\n\nformer good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had  lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his  conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the\n\nimplicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous\n\nthen was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every  respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for  happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and\n\nindecorum of her own family!\n\n\n\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of\n\nWickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy\n\nspirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so\n\nmuch affected as to make it almost impossible for her to\n\nappear tolerably cheerful.\n\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the\n\nlast week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last\n\nevening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired  minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them  directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent\n\non the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that\n\nMaria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\n\nWhen  they  parted,  Lady  Catherine,  with  great\n\ncondescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them\n\nto come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh  exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to\n\nboth.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 38.\n\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he\n\ndeemed indispensably necessary.\n\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs.\n\nCollins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the\n\nhouse without receiving her thanks for it. The favor of your\n\ncompany has been much felt, I assure you. We know how  little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain  manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the\n\nlittle we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull\n\nto a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us  grateful for the condescension, and that we have done  everything in our power to prevent your spending your time\n\nunpleasantly.\"\n\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions\n\nshe had received, must make HER feel the obliged. Mr.\n\nCollins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:\n\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed\n\nyour time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best;\n\n\n\nand most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you  to very superior society, and, from our connection with\n\nRosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home\n\nscene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford  visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with  regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of\n\nextraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.\n\nYou see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not\n\nthink anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they\n\nare sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\n\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth\n\ntried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\n\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into  Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you  will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.\n\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust\n\nit does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me  assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart\n\nmost cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear\n\nCharlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.  There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\n\n\n\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been\n\ndesigned for each other.\"\n\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness\n\nwhere that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add,  that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them\n\ninterrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor\n\nCharlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask\n\nfor compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish\n\nand her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet\n\nlost their charms.\n \nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on,\n\nthe parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.\n\nAfter an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his\n\nbest respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the\n\nkindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his  compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He\n\nthen handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the\n\npoint of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\n\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave\n\nany message for the ladies at Rosings.\n\n\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your\n\nhumble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks\n\nfor their kindness to you while you have been here.\"\n\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to\n\nbe shut, and the carriage drove off.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence,\n\n\"it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet h ow\n\nmany things have happened!\"\n\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\n\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea\n\nthere twice! How much I shall have to tell!\" Elizabeth added\n\nprivately, \"And how much I shall have to conceal!\"\n\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford\n\nthey reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain\n\na few days.\n\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which\n\nthe kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was\n\nto go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure\n\nenough for observation.\n\n\n\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could\n\nwait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.\n\nDarcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of\n\nrevealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must,  at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity  she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a\n\ntemptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but\n\nthe state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent\n\nof what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once\n\nentered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating\n\nsomething of Bingley which might only grieve her sister\n\nfurther.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 39.\n\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed\n\ninn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they\n\nquickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality,  both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.  These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily\n\nemployed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the\n\nsentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.\n\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually\n\naffords, exclaiming, \"Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable\n\nsurprise?\"\n\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you\n\nmust lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the\n\nshop out there.\" Then, showing her purchases--\"Look here, I\n\nhave bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I  thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as  soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.\"\n\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with\n\nperfect unconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much  uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very\n\ntolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears\n\n\n\nthis summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are\n\ngoing in a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest\n\nsatisfaction.\n \n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so\n\nwant papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be\n\nsuch a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost\n\nanything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things!\n\nOnly think what a miserable summer else we shall have!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"THAT would be a delightful\n\nscheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good\n\nHeaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\"\n\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they\n\nsat down at table. \"What do you think? It is excellent newscapital news--and about a certain person we all like!\"\n\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter\n\nwas told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:\n\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You  thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he  often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is\n\nan ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long\n\n\n\nchin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear  Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no\n\ndanger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you!\n\nShe is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.\n\nWickham is safe.\"\n \n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a\n\nconnection imprudent as to fortune.\"\n\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\n\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\"\n\nsaid Jane.\n \n\"I am sure there is not on HIS. I will answer for it, he\n\nnever cared three straws about her--who could about such a\n\nnasty little freckled thing?\"\n\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of\n\nsuch coarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of\n\nthe SENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had\n\nharboured and fancied liberal!\n \nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage\n\nwas ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party,\n\nwith all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the  unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were\n\nseated in it.\n\n\n\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia. \"I am\n\nglad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having\n\nanother bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and\n\nsnug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first  place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went  away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\n\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a\n\nhusband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid  soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how  ashamed I should be of not being married before three-\n\nandtwenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands,\n\nyou can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.  Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in  it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you;\n\nand then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me!\n\nwe had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel  Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.  Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the\n\nbye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she\n\nasked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so  Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you  think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's\n\nclothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not\n\na soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and  me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her  gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When\n\nDenny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the\n\nmen came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I\n\n\n\nlaughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have  died. And THAT made the men suspect something, and then\n\nthey soon found out what was the matter.\"\n\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to\n\nLongbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there\n\nwas no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.\n\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet\n\nre j  oiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than\n\nonce during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to\n\nElizabeth:\n \n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\n\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\n\nLucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various\n\nwere the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was  inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest  daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand\n\ncollecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who\n\nsat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all  to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder  than any other person's, was enumerating the various\n\npleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we\n\nhad such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the\n\nblinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I\n\nshould have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick;  and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very  handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold\n\nluncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would\n\nhave treated you too. And then when we came away it was  such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I  was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all\n\nthe way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody\n\nmight have heard us ten miles off!\"\n\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would\n\ndoubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.\n\nBut I confess they would have no charms for ME--I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\n\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom\n\nlistened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never\n\nattended to Mary at all.\n\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but\n\nElizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said\n\nthat the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before  they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason\n\n\n\ntoo for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham  again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\n\ncomfort to HER of the regiment's approaching removal was\n\nindeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and  once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague\n\nher on his account.\n \nShe had not been many hours at home before she found\n\nthat the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a  hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her  parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the\n\nsmallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the\n\nsame time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though  often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at\n\nlast.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 40.\n\nElizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was\n\nconcerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to\n\nher the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\n\nDarcy and herself.\n\nMiss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the\n\nstrong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of\n\nElizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should\n\nhave delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to\n\nrecommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\n\nunhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.\n\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she,\n\n\"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how\n\nmuch it must increase his disappointment!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him;  but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive  away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for\n\nrefusing him?\"\n\n\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\n\n\n\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of\n\nWickham?\"\n \n\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what\n\nyou did.\"\n\n\"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened\n\nthe very next day.\"\n\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its con\n\ntents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a  stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone  through the world without believing that so much wickedness\n\nexisted in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in\n\none individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful  to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error,\n\nand seek to clear the one without involving the other.\n\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able  to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice,  but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a\n\nquantity of merit between them; just enough to make one\n\ngood sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty  much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but  you shall do as you choose.\"\n\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be\n\nextorted from Jane.\n\n\n\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she.\n\n\"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr.\n\nDarcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\n\nSuch a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by\n\nseeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample  justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned  and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you\n\nlament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a\n\nfeather.\"\n \n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness\n\nin his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his\n\nmanner!\"\n \n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the  education of those two young men. One has got all the  goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\n\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the\n\nAPPEARANCE of it as you used to do.\"\n\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so\n\ndecided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur\n\nto one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of\n\nthat kind. One may be continually abusive without saying\n\n\n\nanything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man\n\nwithout now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\n\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could\n\nnot treat the matter as you do now.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may\n\nsay unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt,\n\nno Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very\n\nweak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I\n\nwanted you!\"\n\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such v ery\n\nstrong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for\n\nnow they DO appear wholly undeserved.\"\n\n\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness\n\nis a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\n\nencouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice.\n\nI want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character.\"\n\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there\n\ncan be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is\n\nyour opinion?\"\n\n\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not\n\nauthorised me to make his communication public. On the\n\ncontrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be\n\n\n\nkept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to  undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will\n\nbelieve me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so\n\nviolent, that it would be the death of half the good people in  Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not  equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will\n\nnot signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence\n\nit will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their  stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say  nothing about it.\"\n\n\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might\n\nruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has\n\ndone, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not\n\nmake him desperate.\"\n\nThe tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this\n\nconversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had  weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing  listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of\n\neither. But there was still something lurking behind, of which\n\nprudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other  half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how  sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was\n\nknowledge in which no one could partake; and she was\n\nsensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding  between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last  encumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very\n\n\n\nimprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be  able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable\n\nmanner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be\n\nmine till it has lost all its value!\"\n \nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not\n\nhappy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.\n\nHaving never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments\n\noften boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\n\nand prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and  all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to  check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been\n\ninjurious to her own health and their tranquillity.\n\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your  opinion NOW of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I  am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told\n\nmy sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that\n\nJane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no\n\ntalk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I\n\nhave inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\n\n\n\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any\n\nmore.\"\n \n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to\n\ncome. Though I shall always say he used my daughter  extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart;\n\nand then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\n\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\n\nexpectation, she made no answer.\n\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards,\n\n\"and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well,\n\nwell, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they  keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is  half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is\n\nnothing extravagant in THEIR housekeeping, I dare say.\"\n\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\n\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes,\n\nyes. THEY will take care not to outrun their income. THEY\n\nwill never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it\n\ndo them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having  Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as  quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\n\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\n\n\n\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no\n\ndoubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they\n\ncan be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so\n\nmuch the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was\n\nonly entailed on me.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 41.\n\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping\n\napace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss\n\nBennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia,\n\nwhose own misery was extreme, and who could not\n\ncomprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family.\n\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to\n\ndo?\" would they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe. \"How\n\ncan you be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\n\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she\n\nremembered what she had herself endured on a similar\n\noccasion, five and-twenty years ago.\n\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when\n\nColonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall break MINE,\" said Lydia.\n\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\n\ndisagreeable.\"\n\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\n\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal\n\nof good,\" added Kitty.\n\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\n\nthrough Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by\n\nthem; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt  anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she  been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views\n\nof his friend.\n \nBut the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to\n\nBrighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman,\n\nand very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and  good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other,  and out of their THREE months' acquaintance they had been\n\nintimate TWO.\n \nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of  Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to\n\nher sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless\n\necstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing\n\n\n\nand talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless  Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as\n\nunreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well  as Lydia,\" said she, \"Though I am NOT her particular friend. I  have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too,\n\nfor I am two years older.\"\n\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and  Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as\n\nin her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death\n\nwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and  detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she  could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.\n\nShe represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general\n\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the  friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the  probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a\n\ncompanion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater\n\nthan at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:\n\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in\n\nsome public place or other, and we can never expect her to do\n\nit with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as\n\nunder the present circumstances.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great\n\ndisadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice\n\nof Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner--nay, which has\n\nalready arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently\n\nin the affair.\"\n \n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she\n\nfrightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But\n\ndo not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to  be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.  Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept\n\naloof by Lydia's folly.\"\n\n\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent.  It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now  complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world\n\nmust be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and\n\ndisdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse  me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not  take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of\n\nteaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the\n\nbusiness of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of\n\namendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at\n\nsixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or\n\nher family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest\n\ndegree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a  tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her  mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\n\n\n\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this  danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever\n\nLydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!\n\nOh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?\"\n\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject,\n\nand affectionately taking her hand said in reply:\n\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you\n\nand Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and\n\nyou will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--\n\nor I may say, three--very silly sisters. We shall have no peace  at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go,  then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out\n\nof any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\n\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less  importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\n\nThe officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us\n\nhope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own\n\ninsignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees  worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her\n\nlife.\"\n \nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but\n\nher own opinion continued the same, and she left him  disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to\n\n\n\nincrease her vexations by dwelling on them. She was  confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over\n\nunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of\n\nher disposition.\n\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly\n\nhave found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's\n\nimagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of  earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the  streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She\n\nsaw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of\n\nthem at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp-its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines,  crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with\n\nscarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated\n\nbeneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at\n\nonce.\n \nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such\n\nprospects and such realities as these, what would have been\n\nher sensations? They could have been understood only by her  mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to  Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy\n\nconviction of her husband's never intending to go there\n\nhimself.\n\n\n\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very\n\nday of Lydia's leaving home.\n\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\n\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal\n\npartiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very\n\ngentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a  sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to  herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for\n\nthe inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions\n\nwhich had marked the early part of their acquaintance could  only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She  lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the\n\nobject of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she\n\nsteadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained  in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause,  his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be\n\ngratified, and her preference secured at any time by their\n\nrenewal.\n \nOn the very last day of the regiment's remaining at\n\nMeryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn;\n\nand so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good\n\nhumour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in  which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned  Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\n\n\n\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with\n\nthe former.\n \nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a\n\nmoment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he  had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was  a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.\n\nHer answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of\n\nindifference he soon afterwards added:\n \n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\n\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\n\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\n\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\n\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin's.\"\n\n\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\n\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not\n\nescape her. \"And pray, may I ask?--\" But checking himself, he\n\nadded, in a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves? Has  he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?--for I  dare not hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone,\n\n\"that he is improved in essentials.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is\n\nvery much what he ever was.\"\n\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing\n\nwhether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.  There was a something in her countenance which made him  listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she\n\nadded:\n \n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not\n\nmean that his mind or his manners were in a state of\n\nimprovement, but that, from knowing him better, his\n\ndisposition was better understood.\"\n\nWickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minute he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and\n\nsaid in the gentlest of accents:\n\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy,  will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he  is wise enough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is\n\nright. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to\n\nhimself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such  foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort  of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,\n\nis merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\n\nopinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her  has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a\n\n\n\ngood deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the  match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very\n\nmuch at heart.\"\n \nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances,\n\nand she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the\n\nevening passed with the APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual  cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish  Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and\n\npossibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.\n\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was\n\nrather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed\n\ntears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet  was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,  and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\n\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice\n\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well  attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself  in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were\n\nuttered without being heard.\n\n\n\nChapter 42.\n\nHad Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated\n\nby youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour\n\nwhich youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman  whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early  in their marriage put and end to all real affection for her.\n\nRespect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and\n\nall his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr.  Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the  disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in\n\nany of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate\n\nfor their folly of their vice. He was fond of the country and of  books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal  enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted,\n\nthan as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his\n\namusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man  would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other  powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will\n\nderive benefit from such as are given.\n\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the\n\nimpropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband. She had  always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and\n\ngrateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she\n\nendeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\n\n\n\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal  obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the\n\ncontempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.\n\nBut she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-\n\njudged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\n\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his  daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\n\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure\n\nshe found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the\n\nregiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before,\n\nand at home she had a mother and sister whose constant\n\nrepinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a\n\nreal gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might\n\nin time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\n\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose\n\ndisposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to\n\nbe hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of\n\nsuch double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the\n\nwhole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes been\n\nfound before, that an event to which she had been looking\n\nwith impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the\n\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently  necessary to name some other period for the commencement  of actual felicity-to have some other point on which her\n\nwishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the\n\n\n\npleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and  prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was\n\nnow the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best\n\nconsolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the\n\ndiscontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and  could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it\n\nwould have been perfect.\n\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to  wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my  disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with\n\nme one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I\n\nmay reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure  realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can  never be successful; and general disappointment is only\n\nwarded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.\"\n\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to\n\nher mother contained little else than that they were just\n\nreturned from the library, where such and such officers had\n\nattended them, and where she had seen such beautiful\n\nornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown,\n\nor a new parasol, which she would have described more fully,\n\nbut was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster  called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her  correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be\n\n\n\nlearnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were\n\nmuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.\n\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence,\n\nhealth, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at  Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families  who had been in town for the winter came back again, and\n\nsummer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\n\nwas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the  middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to  enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise\n\nas to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she\n\nmight be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer  above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious  arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be\n\nquartered in Meryton.\n\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it,\n\nwhen a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once\n\ndelayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr.\n\nGardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far,\n\nand see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\n\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to  give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and,  according to the present plan, were to go no farther north\n\n\n\nwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be  seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.\n\nGardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where\n\nshe had formerly passed some years of her life, and where  they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an  object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of\n\nMatlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.\n\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied--and\n\ncertainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\n\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. \"But surely,\" said she, \"I\n\nmay enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few\n\npetrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\n\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But\n\nthey did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their\n\nfour children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The  children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger  boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\n\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense\n\nand sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to\n\n\n\nthem in every way-teaching them, playing with them, and\n\nloving them.\n\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set\n\noff the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and  amusement. One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness  of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health\n\nand temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance\n\nevery pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might  supply it among themselves if there were disappointments\n\nabroad.\n \nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of\n\nDerbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick,  Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small\n\npart of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town\n\nof Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence,\n\nand where she had lately learned some acquaintance still  remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the\n\nprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\n\nLambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was\n\nsituated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile\n\nor two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before,\n\nMrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.\n\nMr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\n\n\n\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you\n\nhave heard so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which\n\nso many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham\n\npassed all his youth there, you know.\"\n\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business\n\nat Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for\n\nseeing it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great\n\nhouses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure\n\nin fine carpets or satin curtains.\n\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a\n\nfine house richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about\n\nit myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of\n\nthe finest woods in the country.\"\n\nElizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.\n\nThe possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the\n\nplace, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at  the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly  to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were\n\nobjections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last\n\nresource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family\n\nwere unfavourably answered.\n\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the\n\nchambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\n\nwhat was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,  whether the family were down for the summer? A most\n\n\n\nwelcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms  now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\n\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was\n\nrevived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could  readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she  had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley,\n\ntherefore, they were to go.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 43.\n\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a\n\nhigh flutter.\n\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide\n\nextent.\n \nElizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw\n\nand admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They  gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves\n\nat the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,\n\nand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House,  situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road  with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\n\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a\n\nridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some  natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any  artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely\n\nadorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place\n\nfor which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had  been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all\n\nof them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt\n\nthat to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n\n\n\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house,\n\nall her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She\n\ndreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On\n\napplying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and  Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\n\nwonder at her being where she was.\n\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-\n\nparlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely\n\nfitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a  window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood,  which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness\n\nfrom the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of\n\nthe ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the  river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the  valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they\n\npassed into other rooms these objects were taking different\n\npositions; but from every window there were beauties to be  seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture  suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw,\n\nwith admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor\n\nuselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance,\n\nthan the furniture of Rosings.\n\n\n\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been\n\nmistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly\n\nacquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might\n\nhave rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as  visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\"--recollecting herself-\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost\n\nto me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\n\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something\n\nvery like regret.\n\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her\n\nmaster was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At\n\nlength however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she  turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he  was, adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\n\nparty of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\n\njourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended,\n\namongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her\n\naunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper  came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young  gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been\n\nbrought up by him at his own expense. \"He is now gone into\n\nthe army,\" she added; \"but I am afraid he has turned out very\n\nwild.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but\n\nElizabeth could not return it.\n \n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\n\nminiatures, \"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at\n\nthe same time as the other--about eight years ago.\"\n\n\"I have heard much of your master's fine person,\" said\n\nMrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.\n\nBut, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\n\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on\n\nthis intimation of her knowing her master.\n\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\n\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\n \n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman,\n\nma'am?\"\n \n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\n\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery  upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.  This room was my late master's favourite room, and these\n\nminiatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond\n\nof them.\"\n\n\n\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being\n\namong them.\n\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss\n\nDarcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.\n\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said\n\nMrs. Gardiner.\n \n\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen;\n\nand so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the  next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a  present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with\n\nhim.\"\n \nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had\n\nevidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\n\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the\n\nyear?\"\n\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may\n\nspend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for\n\nthe summer months.\"\n \n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to\n\nRamsgate.\"\n\n\n\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be. I do not\n\nknow who is good enough for him.\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you\n\nshould think so.\"\n \n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that\n\nknows him,\" replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was  going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment  as the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word\n\nfrom him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was\n\nfour years old.\"\n\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man\n\nhad been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was\n\nawakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her\n\nuncle for saying:\n\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.\n\nYou are lucky in having such a master.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I  could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that  they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured\n\n\n\nwhen they grow up; and he was always the sweetesttempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\n\nElizabeth almost stared at her. \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\"\n\nthought she.\n\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n \n\"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just\n\nlike him--just as affable to the poor.\"\n\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the\n\ndimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in\n\nvain, Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family  prejudice  to  which  he  attributed  her  excessive  commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject;\n\nand she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they\n\nproceeded together up the great staircase.\n\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she,\n\n\"that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who\n\nthink of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his\n\ntenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some  people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of  it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like\n\nother young men.\"\n\n\n\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought\n\nElizabeth.\n \n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they\n\nwalked, \"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor\n\nfriend.\"\n \n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\n\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\n\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were\n\ninformed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss\n\nDarcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at\n\nPemberley.\n\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she\n\nwalked towards one of the windows.\n \nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added. \"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure\n\nto be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for\n\nher.\"\n \nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal\n\nbedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former\n\n\n\nwere many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the  art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had\n\nwillingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in\n\ncrayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n\nalso more intelligible.\n\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they\n\ncould have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth\n\nwalked in quest of the only face whose features would be  known to her. At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking  resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as\n\nshe remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at\n\nher. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest  contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the  gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken\n\nin his father's lifetime.\n \nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation\n\nbestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature.\n\nWhat praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent\n\nservant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered\n\nhow many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\n\nmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how\n\nmuch of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that  had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable\n\nto his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which\n\n\n\nhe was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she  thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than\n\nit had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\n\nsoftened its impropriety of expression.\n\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of\n\nthe housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who\n\nmet them at the hall-door.\n \nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also,\n\nand while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the\n\nbuilding, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from\n\nthe road, which led behind it to the stables.\n \nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so\n\nabrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his\n\nsight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were  overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and  for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly\n\nrecovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to\n\nElizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\n\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his\n\napproach, received his compliments with an embarrassment\n\nimpossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his  resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been\n\n\n\ninsufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.  Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his\n\nmaster, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\n\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and  confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew  not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her\n\nfamily. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last\n\nparted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her  embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being  found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which\n\nthey continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her\n\nlife. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his  accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his  inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of\n\nher having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a\n\nway, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\n\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly\n\nrecollected himself, and took leave.\n\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was\n\noverpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was\n\nthe most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!  How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light  might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had\n\n\n\npurposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she  come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was\n\nexpected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should\n\nhave been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was  plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted  from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again\n\nover the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\n\nstrikingly altered--what could it mean? That he should even  speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to  inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his\n\nmanners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such\n\ngentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did  it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his\n\nletter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\n\naccount for it.\n \nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were\n\napproaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was\n\nsensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically  to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to  direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed\n\non that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be,  where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the  moment was passing in his mind--in what manner he thought\n\nof her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still\n\n\n\ndear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt  himself at ease; yet there had been THAT in his voice which\n\nwas not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of\n\npleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had\n\nnot seen her with composure.\n\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her\n\nabsence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of\n\nappearing more like herself.\n\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots\n\nwhere the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,\n\nwere many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,  with the long range of woods overspreading many, and  occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a\n\nwish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\n\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it  was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued  the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some\n\ntime, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the\n\nwater, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a  simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it  was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\n\nvalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\n\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood  which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings;  but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their\n\n\n\ndistance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great  walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to\n\nthe carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\n\nobliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house  on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but  their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able\n\nto indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so\n\nmuch engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some  trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he  advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner,\n\nthey were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was\n\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.  Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk  here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed\n\nthem to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however\n\nastonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than  before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if  he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\n\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path.\n\nThe idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his\n\nrecent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as\n\nthey met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not  got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when  some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that\n\npraise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously\n\nconstrued. Her colour changed, and she said no more.\n\n\n\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of\n\nintroducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility\n\nfor which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly  suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of  some of those very people against whom his pride had\n\nrevolted in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\"\n\nthought she, \"when he knows who they are? He takes them\n\nnow for people of fashion.\"\n\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as\n\nshe named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at\n\nhim, to see how he bore it, and was not without the\n\nexpectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such  disgraceful companions. That he was SURPRISED by the\n\nconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with\n\nfortitude, and so far from going away, turned his back with\n\nthem, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.\n\nElizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It\n\nwas consoling that he should know she had some relations for\n\nwhom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in  every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked\n\nhis intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\n\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard  Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\n\n\n\noffering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle,  and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was\n\nusually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-\n\ninarm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the  compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment,\n\nhowever, was extreme, and continually was she repeating,\n\n\"Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be\n\nfor ME--it cannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus\n\nsoftened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\n\nchange as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\n\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better\n\ninspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a\n\nlittle alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued  by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm  inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her\n\nhusband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they\n\nwalked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke.\n\nShe wished him to know that she had been assured of his\n\nabsence before she came to the place, and accordingly began\n\nby observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--\"for\n\nyour housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that you would  certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left  Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately\n\nexpected in the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all,\n\n\n\nand said that business with his steward had occasioned his\n\ncoming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\n\nwhom he had been travelling. \"They will join me early to-\n\nmorrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some who will  claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\n\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts\n\nwere instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's\n\nname had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she\n\nmight judge by his complexion, HIS mind was not very\n\ndifferently engaged.\n\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued\n\nafter a pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to  you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce  my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\n\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it\n\nwas too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to  it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy  might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of\n\nher brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it\n\nwas gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him\n\nthink really ill of her.\n\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in\n\nthought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible;\n\nbut she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his  sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon\n\n\n\noutstripped the others, and when they had reached the  carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile\n\nbehind.\n \nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared\n\nherself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such  a time much might have been said, and silence was very\n\nawkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an\n\nembargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had  been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale  with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly-\n\nand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before\n\nthe tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming  up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some  refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each\n\nside with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into\n\nthe carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\n\nwalking slowly towards the house.\n\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and\n\neach of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to\n\nanything they had expected. \"He is perfectly well behaved,\n\npolite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\n\n\"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure,\"\n\nreplied her aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not\n\nunbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though\n\nsome people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It\n\nwas more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\n\nnecessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth\n\nwas very trifling.\"\n\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome\n\nas Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance,\n\nfor his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell\n\nme that he was so disagreeable?\"\n\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that\n\nshe had liked him better when they had met in Kent than\n\nbefore, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this\n\nmorning.\n\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\"\n\nreplied her uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I\n\nshall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\n\nanother day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\n\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\n\ncharacter, but said nothing.\n\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs.\n\nGardiner, \"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor  Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary,\n\nthere is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.\n\nAnd there is something of dignity in his countenance that\n\n\n\nwould not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to  be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him\n\na most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud\n\nsometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and THAT in\n\nthe eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.\"\n\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\n\nvindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave\n\nthem to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that  by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions  were capable of a very different construction; and that his\n\ncharacter was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so\n\namiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In  confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the  pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected,\n\nwithout actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such\n\nas such as might be relied on.\n\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures,\n\nevery idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was\n\ntoo much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the  interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else.  Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no\n\nsooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\n\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of\n\na intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\n\n\n\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends;\n\nand she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of\n\nMr. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 44.\n\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the\n\ninn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false;\n\nfor on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these  visitors came. They had been walking about the place with  some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to\n\ndress themselves for dining with the same family, when the\n\nsound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a  gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street.  Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it\n\nmeant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her\n\nrelations by acquainting them with the honour which she  expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the  embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the\n\ncircumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the\n\npreceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.  Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there  was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\n\na quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While\n\nthese newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the  perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment  increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure;\n\nbut amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the\n\npartiality of the brother should have said too much in her  favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she\n\n\n\nnaturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail\n\nher.\n \nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and\n\nas she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to  compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her  uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\n\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\n\nintroduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see  that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed  as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that\n\nMiss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a\n\nvery few minutes convinced her that she was only  exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word  from her beyond a monosyllable.\n\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth;\n\nand, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed,  and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less  handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good\n\nhumour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\n\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find\n\nin her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.\n\nDarcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such\n\ndifferent feelings.\n\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had\n\n\n\nbarely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a  visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and\n\nin a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger\n\nagainst him had been long done away; but had she still felt  any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the  unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on\n\nseeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general\n\nway, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same\n\ngood-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less\n\ninteresting personage than to herself. They had long wished to\n\nsee him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively  attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy\n\nand their niece directed their observation towards each with\n\nan earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\n\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least  knew what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they  remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was\n\noverflowing with admiration was evident enough.\n\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to\n\nascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to  compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in\n\nthe latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most\n\nsure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give  pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready,  Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\n\n\n\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of\n\nhis were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy\n\nthat he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice\n\npleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he  was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be\n\nimaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to\n\nMiss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his\n\nsister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three\n\nlittle circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her  anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not  untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that\n\nmight lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to\n\nher, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in  a tone which had something of real regret, that it \"was a very  long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and,\n\nbefore she could reply, he added, \"It is above eight months.\n\nWe have not met since the 26th of November, when we were\n\nall dancing together at Netherfield.\"\n\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\n\nafterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by\n\nany of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn.  There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding  remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them\n\nmeaning.\n\n\n\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\n\nexpression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\n\nheard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his\n\ncompanions, as convinced her that the improvement of  manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\n\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one\n\nday. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and  courting the good opinion of people with whom any  intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace--\n\nwhen she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\n\nvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected  their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference,  the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind,\n\nthat she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being\n\nvisible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at  Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen  him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or\n\nunbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result\n\nfrom the success of his endeavours, and when even the\n\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed\n\nwould draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both\n\nof Netherfield as Rosings.\n\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs.\n\nGardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before\n\n\n\nthey left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence  which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\n\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of\n\nknowing how SHE, whom the invitation most concerned, felt  disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away  her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance\n\nspoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of\n\nthe proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of  society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to  engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed\n\non.\n \nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing  Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.\n\nElizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak\n\nof her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some  others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of  considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though\n\nwhile it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager\n\nto be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle  and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their  favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to\n\ndress.\n \nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's\n\ncuriosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It  was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr.\n\n\n\nDarcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest,\n\nbut nothing to justify inquiry.\n\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had\n\nthey drawn his character from their own feelings and his\n\nservant's report, without any reference to any other account,\n\nthe circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not\n\nhave recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\n\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became\n\nsensible that the authority of a servant who had known him  since he was four years old, and whose own manners  indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither\n\nhad anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton\n\nfriends that could materially lessen its weight. They had  nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and  if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a\n\nsmall market-town where the family did not visit. It was\n\nacknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did\n\nmuch good among the poor.\n\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he\n\nwas not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of\n\nhis concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly  understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting\n\n\n\nDerbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\n\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\n\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this\n\nevening more than the last; and the evening, though as it  passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her  feelings towards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two\n\nwhole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly\n\ndid not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she  had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike  against him, that could be so called. The respect created by\n\nthe conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first\n\nunwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be  repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into  somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\n\nhis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable\n\na light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above  respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill  which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not\n\nmerely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well\n\nenough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her  manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations  accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded,\n\nwould avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\n\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance,  and without any indelicate display of regard, or any  peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were\n\nconcerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and\n\n\n\nbent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a  man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but\n\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as\n\nsuch its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as  by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly  defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\n\nshe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to\n\nknow how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,  and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she  should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\n\npossessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.\n\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for\n\nshe had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be\n\nimitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of  politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be  highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\n\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased;\n\nthough when she asked herself the reason, she had very little\n\nto say in reply.\n\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing\n\nscheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive\n\nengagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at\n\nPemberley before noon.\n\n\n\nChapter 45.\n\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be\n\nto her, and was curious to know with how much civility on\n\nthat lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\n\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful\n\nfor summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a\n\nmost refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the  house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which\n\nwere scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n \nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\n\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady  with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of  them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment\n\nwhich, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing\n\nwrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior  the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and  her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by\n\na curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as  such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It  was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-\n\nlooking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of\n\n\n\ndiscourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of\n\nthe others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with\n\noccasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried\n\non. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to  join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when  there was least danger of its being heard.\n\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by\n\nMiss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter,\n\nhad they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she\n\nwas not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her  own thoughts were employing her. She expected every  moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.\n\nShe wished, she feared that the master of the house might be\n\namongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she  could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a  quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice,\n\nElizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry\n\nafter the health of her family. She answered with equal\n\nindifference and brevity, and the others said no more.\n\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced\n\nby the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety\n\nof all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till  after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to  Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There\n\n\n\nwas now employment for the whole party--for though they  could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful\n\npyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\n\nthem round the table.\n \nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the\n\nappearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on\n\nhis entering the room; and then, though but a moment before  she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to  regret that he came.\n\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two\n\nor three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the  river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the  family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner\n\ndid he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly\n\neasy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to  be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she  saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened\n\nagainst them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not\n\nwatch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no\n\ncountenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in  Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her\n\nface whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had\n\nnot yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy  were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance,\n\nexerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\n\n\n\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and  forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation\n\non either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the\n\nimprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with\n\nsneering civility:\n\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed\n\nfrom Meryton? They must be a great loss to YOUR family.\"\n\nIn Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections\n\nconnected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting\n\nherself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently  answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she  spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a\n\nheightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister\n\novercome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had  Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her  beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from\n\nthe hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth\n\nby bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed  her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure  her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all\n\nthe follies and absurdities by which some part of her family\n\nwere connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever  reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no  creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible,\n\n\n\nexcept to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her  brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\n\nwish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their\n\nbecoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a  plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour  to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might\n\nadd something to his lively concern for the welfare of his\n\nfriend.\n \nElizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\n\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\n\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her  brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected  her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had\n\nbeen designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to\n\nhave fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending\n\nthem to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings\n\nin criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But  Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's recommendation  was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err.\n\nAnd he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave\n\nGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss\n\n\n\nBingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.\n\nDarcy,\" she cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have\n\nknown her again.\"\n\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no\n\nmiraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.\n\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I  never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her  complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\n\nhandsome. Her nose wants character--there is nothing marked\n\nin its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\n\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called  so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.\n\nThey have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all;\n\nand in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without\n\nfashion, which is intolerable.\"\n \nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired\n\nElizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending\n\nherself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing\n\nhim at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she\n\n\n\nexpected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\n\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued:\n\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire,\n\nhow amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty;  and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they  had been dining at Netherfield, 'SHE a beauty!--I should as\n\nsoon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to\n\nimprove on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\n\none time.\"\n \n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no\n\nlonger, \"but THAT was only when I first saw her, for it is\n\nmany months since I have considered her as one of the\n\nhandsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\n\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\n\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\n\npain but herself.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred\n\nduring their visit, as they returned, except what had\n\nparticularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of\n\neverybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person  who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his  sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\n\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.\n\nGardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.\n\n\n\nChapter 46.\n\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding\n\na letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this\n\ndisappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings\n\nthat had now been spent there; but on the third her repining\n\nwas over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters\n\nfrom her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been\n\nmissent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane\n\nhad written the direction remarkably ill.\n\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended\n\nto; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained\n\nan account of all their little parties and engagements, with  such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which  was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave\n\nmore important intelligence. It was to this effect:\n\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has  occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am  afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well. What I\n\nhave to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve\n\nlast night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel  Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with  one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine\n\nour surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly\n\nunexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on\n\n\n\nboth sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his  character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet\n\nI can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over\n\nit) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at  least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our  poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\n\nthankful am I that we never let them know what has been said\n\nagainst him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off  Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not  missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent\n\noff directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten\n\nmiles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him  here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of  their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my\n\npoor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out,\n\nbut I hardly know what I have written.\"\n\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this\n\nletter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost\n\nimpatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later\n\nthan the conclusion of the first.\n \n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my\n\nhurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though\n\nnot confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot  answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what  I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be\n\n\n\ndelayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham  and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be\n\nassured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to\n\nfear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came  yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many  hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F.\n\ngave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\n\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking\n\nthe alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did\n\ntrace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering  that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed  the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known\n\nafter this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I\n\nknow not what to think. After making every possible inquiry\n\non that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\n\nanxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns\n\nin Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--no such\n\npeople had been seen to pass through. With the kindest  concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his  apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I\n\nam sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can\n\nthrow any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very  great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot  think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more\n\neligible for them to be married privately in town than to\n\npursue their first plan; and even if HE could form such a\n\n\n\ndesign against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which  is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\n\nImpossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not\n\ndisposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head  when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W. was not a  man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her\n\nroom. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is\n\nnot to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw  him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\n\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one\n\ncannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have\n\nbeen spared something of these distressing scenes; but now,  as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your  return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\n\ninconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have\n\njust told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I  cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as  possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\n\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\n\nask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel  Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I\n\nam sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow\n\nhim to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and\n\nColonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again tomorrow evening. In such and exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\n\nimmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his\n\ngoodness.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting\n\nfrom her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow\n\nhim, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as\n\nshe reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr.  Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made  him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she,\n\nin whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's\n\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must  leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business  that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.\"\n\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more\n\nfeeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not  detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr.  and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go\n\nyourself.\"\n\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and\n\nshe felt how little would be gained by her attempting to  pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she\n\ncommissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made\n\nher almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress\n\nhome instantly.\n\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support\n\nherself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for\n\nDarcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid. Is\n\n\n\nthere nothing you could take to give you present relief? A\n\nglass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\"\n\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover\n\nherself. \"There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well;  I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just  received from Longbourn.\"\n\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few\n\nminutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched  suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his  concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length\n\nshe spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such\n\ndreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My  younger sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown  herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off\n\ntogether from Brighton. YOU know him too well to doubt the\n\nrest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can\n\ntempt him to-she is lost for ever.\"\n\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she\n\nadded in a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have\n\nprevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained  some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own  family! Had his character been known, this could not have\n\nhappened. But it is all--all too late now.\"\n\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked.\n\nBut is it certain--absolutely certain?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday nig ht,\n\nand were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are\n\ncertainly not gone to Scotland.\"\n\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to\n\nrecover her?\"\n \n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg\n\nmy uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope,\n\nin half-an-hour. But nothing can be done--I know very well  that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked  on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the\n\nsmallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\n\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\n\n\"When MY eyes were opened to his real character--Oh!\n\nhad I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not-\n\n-I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched\n\nmistake!\"\n \nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation,\n\nhis brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed,\n\nand instantly understood it. Her power was sinking;  everything MUST sink under such a proof of family  weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She\n\ncould neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-\n\nconquest brought nothing to her consolatory to her bosom,\n\n\n\nafforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary,  exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes;\n\nand never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\n\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\n \nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.\n\nLydia--the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them\n\nall, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her\n\nface with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to\n\neverything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was  only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her\n\ncompanion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\n\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you  have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to  plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing\n\nconcern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said\n\nor done on my part that might offer consolation to such  distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which  may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate\n\naffair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of\n\nseeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.\n\nSay that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal\n\nthe unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be\n\nlong.\"\n\n\n\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than\n\nthere was at present reason to hope, and leaving his\n\ncompliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting\n\nlook, went away.\n\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it\n\nwas that they should ever see each other again on such terms\n\nof cordiality as had marked their several meetings in  Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the  whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and\n\nvarieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which\n\nwould now have promoted its continuance, and would\n\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\n\nElizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable\n\nnor faulty. But if otherwise--if regard springing from such  sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is  so often described as arising on a first interview with its\n\nobject, and even before two words have been exchanged,\n\nnothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given  somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for  Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her\n\nto seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that\n\nas it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early  example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found  additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.\n\n\n\nNever, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane,\n\nshe thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.\n\nSurprise was the least of her feelings on this development.\n\nWhile the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she\n\nwas all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry\n\na girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and\n\nhow Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared  incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an  attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and\n\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging\n\nin an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no  difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her  understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\n\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in\n\nHertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes\n\nanother, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them\n\nin her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating  but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and  mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did\n\nshe now feel it!\n \nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother\n\n\n\nincapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and  though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for\n\nLydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\n\nimportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was\n\nsevere. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm,\n\nsupposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken\n\nsuddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she\n\neagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading  the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last  with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a\n\nfavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\n\ndeeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it;  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.  Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,\n\nthough expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude;\n\nand all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating  to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as  soon as possible.\n\n\"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs.\n\nGardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\n\nus; was it so?\"\n \n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\n\nengagement. THAT is all settled.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her\n\nroom to prepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to\n\ndisclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\n\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had\n\nElizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained\n\ncertain that all employment was impossible to one so\n\nwretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well\n\nas her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be\n\nwritten to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for\n\ntheir sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole\n\ncompleted; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his  account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and  Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself,\n\nin a shorter space of time than she could have supposed,\n\nseated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 47.\n\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her  uncle, as they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious  consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\n\nyour eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very\n\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design  against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless,  and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am\n\nstrongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her\n\nfriends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed  again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel  Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up\n\nfor a moment.\n \n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of\n\nyour uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of\n\ndecency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot\n\nthink so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so\n\nwholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\n\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every\n\nother neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should\n\nbe so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to\n\nScotland if that had been the case?\"\n\n\n\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no\n\nabsolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\n\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney\n\ncoach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them\n\nwere to be found on the Barnet road.\"\n \n\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may\n\nbe there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more\n\nexceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very  abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they  could be more economically, though less expeditiously,\n\nmarried in London than in Scotland.\"\n \n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection?  Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not  likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account,\n\nwas persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham\n\nwill never marry a woman without some money. He cannot  afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she  beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him,\n\nfor her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by\n\nmarrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of  disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable  elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing\n\nof the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\n\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has  no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my\n\n\n\nfather's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention\n\nhe has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his\n\nfamily, that HE would do as little, and think as little about it,\n\nas any father could do, in such a matter.\"\n\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but\n\nlove of him as to consent to live with him on any terms ot her\n\nthan marriage?\"\n\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied  Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \"that a sister's sense of  decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,\n\nreally, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her\n\njustice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to  think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a  twelvemonth-she has been given up to nothing but amusement\n\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\n\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions  that came in her way. Since the ----shire were first quartered  in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been\n\nin her head. She has been doing everything in her power by\n\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall  I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally  lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\n\ncharm of person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\n\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so\n\nvery ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there,\n\nwhatever might be their former conduct, that she would think\n\ncapable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?\n\nBut Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as\n\nfalse and deceitful as he is insinuating.\"\n\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner,\n\nwhose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all\n\nalive.\n \n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you, the\n\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you  yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he  spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\n\nliberality towards him. And there are other circumstances\n\nwhich I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate;  but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared\n\nto see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the\n\ncontrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and\n\nunpretending as we have found her.\"\n\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant\n\nof what you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent,\n\nand saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\n\n\n\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week\n\nor fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to\n\nwhom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make  our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be  to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood\n\nhad of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\n\nsettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity  of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That SHE could be in any danger from the deception never\n\nentered my head. That such a consequence as THIS could\n\nensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my\n\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\n\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of  affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been  perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on\n\nwhich it could be thrown away. When first he entered the\n\ncorps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all  were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses  about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished\n\nHER by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a\n\nmoderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her  fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who\n\n\n\ntreated her with more distinction, again became her\n\nfavourites.\"\n \n* * * * *\n \nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could\n\ndetain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.\n\nFrom Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping\n\none night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the  next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane  could not have been wearied by long expectations.\n\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\n\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the  paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the  joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself\n\nover their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was\n\nthe first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came\n\nrunning down from her mother's apartment, immediately met\n\nher.\n\n\n\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether\n\nanything had been heard of the fugitives.\n\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is\n\ncome, I hope everything will be well.\"\n\n\"Is my father in town?\"\n\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\n\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\n\n\"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on\n\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give\n\nme his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He\n\nmerely added that he should not write again till he had\n\nsomething of importance to mention.\"\n\n\"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?\"\n\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\n\ngreatly shaken. She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction  in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room.  Mary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\n\n\"But you--how are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale.\n\nHow much you must have gone through!\"\n\n\n\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was\n\nnow put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane\n\nran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them\n\nboth, with alternate smiles and tears.\n \nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions\n\nwhich Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by  the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence  to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\n\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\n\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every  morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her  father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\n\ntheir marriage.\n\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret,\n\ninvectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and\n\ncomplaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming  everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the  errors of her daughter must principally be owing.\n\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going\n\nto Brighton, with all my family, THIS would not have  happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.\n\n\n\nWhy did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for\n\nshe is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been\n\nwell looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to  have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I\n\nknow he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then\n\nhe will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The\n\nCollinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall\n\ndo.\"\n \nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.  Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very\n\nnext day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for\n\nrecovering Lydia.\n\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is\n\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\n\non it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\n\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as\n\nI get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come\n\nhome with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may\n\nconsult together as to what is to be done.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is\n\nexactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you\n\nget to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they\n\nare not married already, MAKE them marry. And as for  wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia  she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\n\nafter they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from\n\nfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am  frightened out of my wits--and have such tremblings, such  flutterings, all over me-such spasms in my side and pains in\n\nmy head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by\n\nnight nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any\n\ndirections about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does\n\nnot know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\n\nkind you are! I know you will contrive it all.\"\n\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his\n\nearnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid\n\nrecommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her\n\nfear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was\n\non the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the\n\nhousekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\n\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there\n\nwas no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family,\n\nthey did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had  not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants,  while they waited at table, and judged it better that ONE only\n\n\n\nof the household, and the one whom they could most trust  should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\n\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and\n\nKitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from\n\nher books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both,\n\nhowever, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in\n\neither, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger  which she had herself incurred in this business, had given  more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for\n\nMary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to\n\nElizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\n\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be\n\nmuch talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour\n\ninto the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly\n\nconsolation.\"\n \nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying,\n\nshe added, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may\n\ndraw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female\n\nis irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;  that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and\n\nthat she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards\n\nthe undeserving of the other sex.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued\n\nto console herself with such kind of moral extractions from\n\nthe evil before them.\n \nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to\n\nbe for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly\n\navailed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries,\n\nwhich Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in  general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event,\n\nwhich Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\n\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former\n\ncontinued the subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and  everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me  further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no\n\napprehension of anything before the elopement took place?\n\nThey must have seen them together for ever.\"\n\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\n\npartiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him\n\nany alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was\n\nattentive and kind to the utmost. He WAS coming to us, in  order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of  their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first\n\ngot abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\n\n\n\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not\n\nmarry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel\n\nForster seen Denny himself?\"\n\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied  knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real  opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\n\nmar-rying--and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might\n\nhave been misunderstood before.\"\n \n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\n\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\n\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our\n\nbrains? I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's  happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his  conduct had not been always quite right. My father and\n\nmother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a\n\nmatch it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural  triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's  last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had\n\nknown, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many\n\nweeks.\"\n \n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\n\n\"No, I believe not.\"\n\n\n\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\n\nhimself? Does he know his real character?\"\n \n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham\n\nas he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and  extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is  said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may\n\nbe false.\"\n \n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we\n\nknew of him, this could not have happened!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.\n\n\"But to expose the former faults of any person without\n\nknowing what their present feelings were, seemed\n\nunjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\"\n\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's\n\nnote to his wife?\"\n \n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\n\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to\n\nElizabeth. These were the contents:\n \n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,\n\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I  cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow\n\n\n\nmorning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna  Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you\n\na simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love,\n\nand he is an angel. I should never be happy without him,\n\nso think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word\n\nat Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will\n\nmake the surprise the greater, when I write to them and\n\nsign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke it will  be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses  to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with\n\nhim to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\n\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next\n\nball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my  clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell\n\nSally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown\n\nbefore they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to  Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.\n\n\"Your affectionate friend,\n \n\"LYDIA BENNET.\"\n \n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth\n\nwhen she had finished it. \"What a letter is this, to be written at\n\nsuch a moment! But at least it shows that SHE was serious on\n\nthe subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards\n\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of infamy.\n\nMy poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\n\n\n\n\"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a  word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill\n\nimmediately, and the whole house in such confusion!\"\n\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging  to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the  day?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at\n\nsuch a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and  though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my  power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done!\n\nBut the horror of what might possibly happen almost took\n\nfrom me my faculties.\"\n\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.\n\nYou do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have\n\nhad every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\n\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have  shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right  for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary\n\nstudies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken\n\nin on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after  my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday  with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady\n\nLucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday\n\nmorning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any\n\nof her daughters', if they should be of use to us.\"\n\n\n\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth;\n\n\"perhaps she MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as\n\nthis, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance\n\nis impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over\n\nus at a distance, and be satisfied.\"\n \nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\n\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery\n\nof his daughter.\n\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the\n\nplace where they last changed horses, see the postilions and\n\ntry if anything could be made out from them. His principal\n\nobject must be to discover the number of the hackney coach  which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from  London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\n\ngentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another\n\nmight be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If  he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had  before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries\n\nthere, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the\n\nstand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other  designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be  gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had\n\ndifficulty in finding out even so much as this.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 48.\n\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all\n\ncommon occasions, a most negligent and dilatory\n\ncorrespondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing  intelligence to send; but even of THAT they would have been\n\nglad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters\n\nbefore he set off.\n \nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle\n\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\n\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in\n\nHertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to\n\nthem in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited\n\nthem frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of  cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came  without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's\n\nextravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without\n\nleaving them more dispirited than she found them.\n\n\n\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He\n\nwas declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place,\n\nand his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had  been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody  declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;\n\nand everybody began to find out that they had always\n\ndistrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though\n\nshe did not credit above half of what was said, believed\n\nenough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more\n\ncertain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became\n\nalmost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come  when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never  before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have\n\ngained some news of them.\n\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his\n\nwife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his\n\narrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and\n\npersuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr.\n\nBennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in\n\ntown, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone\n\nto one of them, on their first coming to London, before they  procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any  success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it,\n\nhe meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.\n\n\n\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also a\n\npostscript to this effect:\n\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out,\n\nif possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the  regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\n\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\n\nconcealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply  to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be  of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide\n\nus. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his\n\npower to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts,  perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living,  better than any other person.\"\n\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\n \ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her  power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as  the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having\n\nhad any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom\n\nhad been dead many years. It was possible, however, that  some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give  more information; and though she was not very sanguine in\n\nexpecting it, the application was a something to look forward\n\nto.\n\n\n\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.\n\nThe arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's\n\nimpatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to  be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day  was expected to bring some news of importance.\n\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter\n\narrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.  Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that  came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and\n\nElizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were,\n\nlooked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:\n \n\"MY DEAR SIR,\n \n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my\n\nsituation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction\n\nyou are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday  informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear  sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with\n\nyou and all your respectable family, in your present distress,\n\nwhich must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from  a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be  wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--\n\nor that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of\n\nall others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of  your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\n\n\n\nthis. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason\n\nto suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this\n\nlicentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded\n\nfrom a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,  for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined  to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she\n\ncould not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.\n\nHowsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have\n\nrelated the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that\n\nthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes  of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself  condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a\n\nfamily? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect,\n\nwith augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last\n\nNovember; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\n\ninvolved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise\n\nyou, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to\n\nthrow off your unworthy child from your affection for ever,\n\nand leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.\n\n\"I am, dear sir, etc., etc.\"\n \nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an\n\nanswer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a  pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a  single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and\n\nit was certain that he had no near one living. His former\n\n\n\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in  the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\n\nfriendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who\n\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in  the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very  powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of\n\ndiscovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he\n\nhad left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable\n\namount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand\n\npounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\n\nHe owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were\n\nstill more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal  these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them  with horror. \"A gamester!\" she cried. \"This is wholly\n\nunexpected. I had not an idea of it.\"\n\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was  Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their\n\nendeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty\n\nthat he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do  whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for  continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this,\n\nshe did not express so much satisfaction as her children\n\nexpected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been\n\nbefore.\n\n\n\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she\n\ncried. \"Sure he will not leave London before he has found\n\nthem. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if\n\nhe comes away?\"\n\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the\n\nsame time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore,\n\ntook them the first stage of their journey, and brought its\n\nmaster back to Longbourn.\n\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about\n\nElizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her\n\nfrom that part of the world. His name had never been  voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind  of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their\n\nbeing followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\n\nElizabeth had received none since her return that could come\n\nfrom Pemberley.\n\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\n\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\n\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though  Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted  with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she\n\nknown nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\n\nLydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.\n\n\n\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever\n\nbeen in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business\n\nthat had taken him away, and it was some time before his\n\ndaughters had courage to speak of it.\n\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at\n\ntea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then,\n\non her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have  endured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that. Who should suffer  but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\n\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied\n\nElizabeth.\n \n\"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human\n\nnature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my\n\nlife feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of\n\nbeing overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon\n\nenough.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\n\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\n\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\n\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her\n\nresidence there will probably be of some duration.\"\n\n\n\nThen after a short silence he continued:\n \n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your\n\nadvice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows\n\nsome greatness of mind.\"\n\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch\n\nher mother's tea.\n \n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives\n\nsuch an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the  same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering  gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may\n\ndefer it till Kitty runs away.\"\n\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully. \"If  I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than  Lydia.\"\n\n\"YOU go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as\n\nEastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through\n\nthe village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you\n\nstand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out  of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of  every day in a rational manner.\"\n\n\n\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to\n\ncry.\n \n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy. If\n\nyou are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a\n\nreview at the end of them.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 49.\n\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding\n\nthat she came to call them to their mother, went forward to\n\nmeet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they  approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon,  madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might\n\nhave got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of\n\ncoming to ask.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from\n\ntown.\"\n \n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment,\n\n\"don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr.\n\nGardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had\n\na letter.\"\n \nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for\n\nspeech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom; from thence to the library; their father was in neither;  and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their\n\nmother, when they were met by the butler, who said:\n\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking\n\ntowards the little copse.\"\n\n\n\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the\n\nhall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who\n\nwas deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on\n\none side of the paddock.\n\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister,\n\npanting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\n\n\"Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from\n\nmy uncle?\"\n\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\n\n\"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\"\n\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the\n\nletter from his pocket. \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\n\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now\n\ncame up.\n \n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know\n\nmyself what it is about.\"\n\n\"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.\n\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,\n\n\n\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece,\n\nand such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you\n\nsatisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was\n\nfortunate enough to find out in what part of London they  were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to  know they are discovered. I have seen them both--\"\n\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are\n\nmarried!\"\n \nElizabeth read on:\n \n\"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I\n\nfind there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing\n\nto perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on  your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is  required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,\n\nher equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among\n\nyour children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,  moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during  your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are\n\nconditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation\n\nin complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for  you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in  bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from\n\nthese particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so\n\nhopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has  been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will\n\n\n\nbe some little money, even when all his debts are discharged,  to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I\n\nconclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in\n\nyour name throughout the whole of this business, I will  immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a  proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for\n\nyour coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn,\n\nand depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer  as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have  judged it best that my niece should be married from this\n\nhouse, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-\n\nday. I shall write again as soon as anything more is\n\ndetermined on. Yours, etc.,\n \n\"EDW. GARDINER.\"\n \n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.\n\n\"Can it be possible that he will marry her?\"\n\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought\n\nhim,\" said her sister. \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\n\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\n\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\n \nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more\n\ntime before he wrote.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write\n\nimmediately. Consider how important every moment is in\n\nsuch a case.\"\n \n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the\n\ntrouble yourself.\"\n\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\n\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked\n\ntowards the house.\n \n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I\n\nsuppose, must be complied with.\"\n\n\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so\n\nlittle.\"\n \n\"And they MUST marry! Yet he is SUCH a man!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be\n\ndone. But there are two things that I want very much to know;\n\none is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it\n\nabout; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\n\n\"Money! My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\n\n\n\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on\n\nso slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life,\n\nand fifty after I am gone.\"\n\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not  occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and  something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings!\n\nGenerous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A\n\nsmall sum could not do all this.\"\n \n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham's a fool if he takes her\n\nwith a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be\n\nsorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our\n\nrelationship.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a\n\nsum to be repaid?\"\n\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in\n\nthought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their  father then went on to the library to write, and the girls\n\nwalked into the breakfast-room.\n \n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as\n\nsoon as they were by themselves. \"How strange this is! And  for THIS we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small  as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his\n\ncharacter, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\"\n\n\n\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he\n\ncertainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for\n\nher. Though our kind uncle has done something towards\n\nclearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or\n\nany thing like it, has been advanced. He has children of his  own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten\n\nthousand pounds?\"\n\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have\n\nbeen,\" said Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on\n\nour sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done\n\nfor them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The\n\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their  taking her home, and affording her their personal protection  and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years\n\nof gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\n\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her  miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a  meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\n\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either\n\nside,\" said Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His  consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is  come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will\n\nsteady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,\n\nand live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their\n\npast imprudence forgotten.\"\n\n\n\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as\n\nneither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to\n\ntalk of it.\"\n \nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether\n\nhe would not wish them to make it known to her. He was\n\nwriting and, without raising his head, coolly replied:\n\n\"Just as you please.\"\n\n\"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?\"\n\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\n\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.\n\nBennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After\n\na slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.\n\nMrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\n\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from\n\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.  To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She  was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\n\nremembrance of her misconduct.\n\n\n\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried. \"This is delightful\n\nindeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be\n\nmarried at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it\n\nwould be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to\n\nsee her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the\n\nwedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them\n\ndirectly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him\n\nhow much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring  the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when\n\nwe meet!\"\n \nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all\n\nunder.\n \n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added,  \"in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he  has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\n\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should\n\ndo it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own,  I and my children must have had all his money, you know;  and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him,\n\nexcept a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I\n\nshall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it  sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I\n\n\n\nam in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will\n\ndictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father\n\nabout the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered\n\nimmediately.\"\n\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some\n\nvery plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some\n\ndifficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to  be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would be of  small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\n\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\n\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed,  and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I  come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty,\n\nrun down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a\n\ngreat deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you  in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you  heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and\n\nyou shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her\n\nwedding.\"\n\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick\n\nof this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might\n\nthink with freedom.\n\n\n\nPoor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but\n\nthat it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it\n\nso; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness\n\nnor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister,  in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago,  she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 50.\n\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of\n\nhis wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than\n\never. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not\n\nhave been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or\n\ncredit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\n\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great\n\nBritain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place. He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense\n\nof his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to\n\nfind out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the\n\nobligation as  soon as he could.\n \nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to\n\nbe perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.\n\nThe son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively\n\nentered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\n\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for\n\n\n\neconomy, and her husband's love of independence had alone\n\nprevented their exceeding their income.\n \nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on\n\nMrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least,\n\nwhich was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no\n\nhesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of  grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,  though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper\n\nhis perfect approbation of all that was done, and his\n\nwillingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for  him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be  prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so\n\nlittle inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.\n\nHe would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money\n\nwhich passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's\n\nexpenses had been very little within that sum.\n\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at\n\npresent was to have as little trouble in the business as\n\npossible. When the first transports of rage which had\n\n\n\nproduced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally\n\nreturned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\n\ndispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he\n\nwas quick in its execution. He begged to know further  particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too  angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\n\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with\n\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne  in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have  been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\n\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\n\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But\n\nthere was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the goodnatured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before\n\nfrom all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of\n\ntheir spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\n\nan husband her misery was considered certain.\n\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs;\n\nbut on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of\n\nher table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of  shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a  daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since\n\nJane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment,\n\nand her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those  attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages,  and servants. She was busily searching through the\n\n\n\nneighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,  without knowing or considering what their income might be,\n\nrejected many as deficient in size and importance.\n\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could  quit it--or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were  larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have\n\nher ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are\n\ndreadful.\"\n \nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn,\n\nhe said to her: \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of\n\nthese houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right  understanding. Into ONE house in this neighbourhood they  shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\n\nimpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\n\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet\n\nwas firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\n\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\n\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she\n\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\n\noccasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his  anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\n\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\n\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she  could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace\n\n\n\nwhich her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's  nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living\n\nwith Wickham a fortnight before they took place.\n\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her\n\nmarriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the\n\nelopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable  beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\n\nspot.\n\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\n\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have\n\nmortified her so much--not, however, from any fear of\n\ndisadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,  there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's  marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was\n\nnot to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with\n\na family where, to every other objection, would now be added  an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man  whom he so justly scorned.\n\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he\n\nwould shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she  had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in\n\n\n\nrational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was  humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly\n\nknew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she\n\ncould no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear  of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining  intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been\n\nhappy with him, when it was no longer likely they should\n\nmeet.\n \nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only\n\nfour months ago, would now have been most gladly and\n\ngratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as  the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there  must be a triumph.\n\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\n\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His  understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\n\nanswered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been\n\nto the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind\n\nmight have been softened, his manners improved; and from  his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she  must have received benefit of greater importance.\n\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\n\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a\n\n\n\ndifferent tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other,\n\nwas soon to be formed in their family.\n\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\n\nindependence, she could not imagine. But how little of  permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only  brought together because their passions were stronger than\n\ntheir virtue, she could easily conjecture.\n\n* * * * *\n \nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr.\n\nBennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance\n\nof his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family;\n\nand concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be  mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter\n\nwas to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on\n\nquitting the militia.\n\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added,  \"as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will  agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as\n\nhighly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr.\n\nWickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in\n\nGeneral ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an\n\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He  promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where\n\n\n\nthey may each have a character to preserve, they will both be  more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him\n\nof our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy\n\nthe various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton,  with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged  myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\n\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall\n\nsubjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all  his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston  has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They\n\nwill then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to\n\nLongbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the  South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\n\nyou and your mother.--Yours, etc.,\n\n\"E. GARDINER.\"\n \nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of\n\nWickham's removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\n\nGardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased\n\nwith it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had  expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had  by no means given up her plan of their residing in\n\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it\n\nwas such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment  where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many\n\nfavourites.\n\n\n\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\" said she, \"it will be quite\n\nshocking to send her away! And there are several of the young\n\nmen, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so\n\npleasant in General----'s regiment.\"\n\nHis daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the\n\nNorth, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and\n\nElizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so\n\nrationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at\n\nLongbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she\n\nwould be able to show her married daughter in the\n\nneighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When  Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his  permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon\n\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.\n\nElizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last\n\nobject of her wishes.\n\n\n\nChapter 51.\n\nTheir sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return\n\nin it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder\n\nMiss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\n\nmust endure.\n \nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast\n\nroom to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet\n\nas the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked\n\nimpenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\n\nLydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave\n\nher hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who\n\nfollowed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity\n\nwhich shewed no doubt of their happiness.\n\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then\n\nturned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather\n\ngained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy  assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to  provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet\n\nwas shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed,\n\n\n\nwild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister,  demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all\n\nsat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some\n\nlittle alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\n\ngreat while since she had been there.\n\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but\n\nhis manners were always so pleasing, that had his character\n\nand his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and  his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would  have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed\n\nhim quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\n\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of  an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\n\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\n\nvariation of colour.\n \nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother\n\ncould neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who  happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his\n\nacquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured\n\nease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They  seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the  world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and\n\nLydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not\n\nhave alluded to for the world.\n\n\n\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I\n\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\n\nhave been things enough happened in the time. Good\n\ngracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of  being married till I came back again! though I thought it\n\nwould be very good fun if I was.\"\n\nHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth\n\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor  saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily  continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am\n\nmarried to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook\n\nWilliam Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the\n\nwindow frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed\n\nand smiled like anything.\"\n\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\n\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them\n\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her  mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, \"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I\n\nam a married woman.\"\n \nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at\n\n\n\nfirst. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see  Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and\n\nto hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\" by each of them; and\n\nin the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and\n\nboast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to\n\nthe breakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband? Is\n\nnot he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy  me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must  all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a\n\npity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\n\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear\n\nLydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be\n\nso?\"\n \n\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\n\nthings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and  see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say  there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good\n\npartners for them all.\"\n\n\"I should like it beyond anything!\" said her mother.\n\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two\n\nof my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands\n\nfor them before the winter is over.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth;\n\n\"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\n\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with\n\nthem. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he\n\nleft London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a\n\nfortnight.\n\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be\n\nso short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about  with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle\n\nwas even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did\n\nnot.\n \nWickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had\n\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\n\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on  by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would  have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he\n\nchose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\n\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances;  and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist  an opportunity of having a companion.\n\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear\n\nWickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world;\n\n\n\nand she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of\n\nSeptember, than any body else in the country.\n\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting\n\nwith her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\n \n\"Lizzy, I never gave YOU an account of my wedding, I\n\nbelieve. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others\n\nall about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\n\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too\n\nlittle said on the subject.\"\n\n\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went\n\noff. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because\n\nWickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us\n\nat the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such\n\na fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would  happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite  distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing,\n\npreaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\n\nsermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I\n\nwas thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I  longed to know whether he would be married in his blue\n\ncoat.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\n\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\n\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\n\nwas with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot  out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or  scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but,\n\nhowever, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the\n\ncarriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon  business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know,  when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was\n\nso frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to\n\ngive me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not  be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten\n\nminutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected\n\nafterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding\n\nneed not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\n\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n\n\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you\n\nknow. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have\n\nsaid a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will\n\nWickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\n\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on\n\nthe subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with\n\ncuriosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly\n\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\n\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put\n\nit out of her power, by running away.\n\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy\n\nhad been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and\n\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do,  and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it,  rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\n\nwith none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\n\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not  bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote  a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\n\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\n\nhad been intended.\n \n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my\n\ncuriosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any\n\nof us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family,\n\nshould have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write  instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent  reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think\n\nnecessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\n\nignorance.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not that I SHALL, though,\" she added to herself, as she\n\nfinished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in\n\nan honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\n\nand stratagems to find it out.\"\n\nJane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to\n\nspeak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall;\n\nElizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries\n\nwould receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a\n\nconfidante.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 52.\n\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she\n\nwas least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the\n\nbenches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter\n\nconvinced her that it did not contain a denial.\n \n\"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.\n\n\"MY DEAR NIECE,\n\n\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this  whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a LITTLE  writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must\n\nconfess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect\n\nit from YOU. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean  to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be  necessary on YOUR side. If you do not choose to understand\n\nme, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised\n\nas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party\n\nconcerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But\n\nif you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more\n\nexplicit.\n\n\"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn,  your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called,  and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before\n\n\n\nI arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as\n\nYOUR'S seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner\n\nthat he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham\n\nwere, and that he had seen and talked with them both;\n\nWickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to\n\ntown with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive\n\nprofessed was his conviction of its being owing to himself\n\nthat Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as\n\nto make it impossible for any young woman of character to\n\nlove or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to\n\nhis mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it  beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His  character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his\n\nduty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which\n\nhad been brought on by himself. If he HAD ANOTHER  motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been  some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but\n\nhe had something to direct his search, which was more than\n\nWE had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for\n\nhis resolving to follow us.\n\n\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some\n\ntime ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from\n\nher charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did  not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,  and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This\n\nMrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\n\n\n\nWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could\n\nget from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I\n\nsuppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did\n\nknow where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had\n\ngone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been\n\nable to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\n\ntheir abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend  procured the wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He  saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His\n\nfirst object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n\nher to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her  friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,  offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found\n\nLydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She\n\ncared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she  would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should  be married some time or other, and it did not much signify\n\nwhen. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he\n\nthought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very  first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never  been HIS design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the\n\nregiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were\n\nvery pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences  of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign  his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\n\ncould conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere,\n\n\n\nbut he did not know where, and he knew he should have\n\nnothing to live on.\n\n\"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister\n\nat once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,  he would have been able to do something for him, and his  situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found,\n\nin reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the\n\nhope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in  some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he  was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate\n\nrelief.\n \n\"They met several times, for there was much to be  discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get;  but at length was reduced to be reasonable.\n\n\"Every thing being settled between THEM, Mr. Darcy's\n\nnext step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he  first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came  home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy\n\nfound, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him,\n\nbut would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your  father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as  your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till\n\nafter the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\n\nand till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had\n\ncalled on business.\n\n\n\n\"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\n\nuncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of\n\ntalk together.\n\n\"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It  was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the  express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very\n\nobstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of\n\nhis character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at  different times, but THIS is the true one. Nothing was to be  done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do\n\nnot speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it),\n\nyour uncle would most readily have settled the whole.\n\n\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more\n\nthan either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.\n\nBut at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being\n\nallowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with  only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely  against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\n\ngave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\n\nthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the  praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther  than yourself, or Jane at most.\n\n\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for\n\nthe young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I  believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\n\n\n\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon HER, and his  commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be\n\ndone by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was\n\nowing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration,\n\nthat Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and\n\nconsequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.\n\nPerhaps there was some truth in THIS; though I doubt\n\nwhether HIS reserve, or ANYBODY'S reserve, can be\n\nanswerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,  my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle\n\nwould never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for\n\nANOTHER INTEREST in the affair.\n \n\"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his\n\nfriends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed\n\nthat he should be in London once more when the wedding\n\ntook place, and all money matters were then to receive the last\n\nfinish.\n \n\"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation\n\nwhich you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least\n\nit will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and\n\nWickham had constant admission to the house. HE was\n\nexactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire;\n\nbut I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her\n\nbehaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by  Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming  home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now\n\n\n\ntell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly  in the most serious manner, representing to her all the\n\nwickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she\n\nhad brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good  luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite  provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\n\nand for their sakes had patience with her.\n\n\"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia  informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the  next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or\n\nThursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I\n\ntake this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough  to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,  in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in\n\nDerbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he\n\nwants nothing but a little more liveliness, and THAT, if he  marry PRUDENTLY, his wife may teach him. I thought him  very sly;-he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness\n\nseems the fashion.\n \n\"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least  do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never  be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low\n\nphaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very\n\nthing.\n\n\n\n\"But I must write no more. The children have been\n\nwanting me this half hour.\n\n\"Yours, very sincerely,\n\n\"M. GARDINER.\"\n \nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of\n\nspirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure\n\nor pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled\n\nsuspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy  might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which  she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too\n\ngreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just,\n\nfrom the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest  extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he\n\nhad taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\n\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\n\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise,  and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason  with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always\n\nmost wished to avoid, and whose very name it was\n\npunishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a  girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did  whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\n\nchecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even\n\nher vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his  affection for her -for a woman who had already refused him--\n\n\n\nas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence\n\nagainst relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of\n\nWickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the\n\nconnection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed\n\nto think how much. But he had given a reason for his  interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It\n\nwas reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had\n\nliberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though  she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she  could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might\n\nassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must\n\nbe materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful,  to know that they were under obligations to a person who  could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of\n\nLydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did\n\nshe grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever  encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards  him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.\n\nProud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been\n\nable to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's  commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough;  but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure,\n\nthough mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she\n\nand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and\n\nconfidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\n\n\n\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path,\n\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.\n\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear\n\nsister?\" said he, as he joined her.\n\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does\n\nnot follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\n\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good\n\nfriends; and now we are better.\"\n \n\"True. Are the others coming out?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\n\ncarriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our\n\nuncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\n\nShe replied in the affirmative.\n\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\n\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to  Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of\n\ncourse she did not mention my name to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, she did.\"\n\n\n\n\"And what did she say?\"\n\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\n\n--not turned out well. At such a distance as THAT, you know,\n\nthings are strangely misrepresented.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she\n\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\n \n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We\n\npassed each other several times. I wonder what he can be\n\ndoing there.\"\n\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\"\n\nsaid Elizabeth. \"It must be something particular, to take him\n\nthere at this time of year.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at\n\nLambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you\n\nhad.\"\n \n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\n \n\"And do you like her?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved\n\nwithin this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very\n\n\n\npromising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn\n\nout well.\"\n \n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\n\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\n\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\n \n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\n\nhad. A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It\n\nwould have suited me in every respect.\"\n\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\n\n\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of\n\nmy duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One\n\nought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a  thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would  have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be.\n\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you\n\nwere in Kent?\"\n \n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought AS GOOD,\n\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\n\npresent patron.\"\n\n\"You have. Yes, there was something in THAT; I told you\n\nso from the first, you may remember.\"\n\n\n\n\"I DID hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-\n\nmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at\n\npresent; that you actually declared your resolution of never\n\ntaking orders, and that the business had been compromised\n\naccordingly.\"\n\n\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You\n\nmay remember what I told you on that point, when first we\n\ntalked of it.\"\n \nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's\n\nsake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-\n\nhumoured smile:\n \n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you\n\nknow. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope\n\nwe shall be always of one mind.\"\n\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate\n\ngallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they\n\nentered the house.\n\n\n\nChapter 53.\n\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject\n\nof it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to\n\nkeep him quiet.\n\nThe day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.\n\nBennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her\n\nhusband by no means entered into her scheme of their all\n\ngoing to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a\n\ntwelvemonth.\n \n\"Oh! my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet\n\nagain?\"\n\n\"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years,\n\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\n\n\"As often as I can. But you know married women have\n\nnever much time for writing. My sisters may write to ME.\n\nThey will have nothing else to do.\"\n\nMr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than\n\nhis wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty\n\nthings.\n\n\n\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they\n\nwere out of the house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks,\n\nand makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I\n\ndefy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more\n\nvaluable son-in-law.\"\n \nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for\n\nseveral days.\n\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as\n\nparting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without\n\nthem.\"\n \n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a\n\ndaughter,\" said Elizabeth. \"It must make you better satisfied\n\nthat your other four are single.\"\n\n\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she\n\nis married, but only because her husband's regiment happens\n\nto be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have\n\ngone so soon.\"\n\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into\n\nwas shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the\n\nagitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to  be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received  orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was\n\ncoming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\n\n\n\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at\n\nJane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.\n\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\"\n\n(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). \"Well, so much  the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us,  you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.\n\nBut, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if\n\nhe likes it. And who knows what MAY happen? But that is  nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to  mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is\n\ncoming?\"\n\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs.  Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and  went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she\n\ntold me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday\n\nat the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the  butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on  Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to\n\nbe killed.\"\n \nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they\n\nwere alone together, she said:\n\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us\n\nof the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But\n\n\n\ndon't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused\n\nfor the moment, because I felt that I SHOULD be looked at. I\n\ndo assure you that the news does not affect me either with\n\npleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;\n\nbecause we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n\nMYSELF, but I dread other people's remarks.\"\n\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not\n\nseen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable  of coming there with no other view than what was  acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and\n\nshe wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there\n\nWITH his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\n\nwithout it.\n \n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor\n\nman cannot come to a house which he has legally hired,\n\nwithout raising all this speculation! I WILL leave him to\n\nhimself.\"\n \nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to\n\nbe her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth\n\ncould easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They  were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen\n\nthem.\n \nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between\n\ntheir parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought\n\nforward again.\n\n\n\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs.\n\nBennet, \"you will wait on him of course.\"\n\n\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and\n\npromised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my  daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a  fool's errand again.\"\n\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such\n\nan attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on\n\nhis returning to Netherfield.\n\n\"'This an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our\n\nsociety, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not\n\nspend my hours in running after my neighbours every time\n\nthey go away and come back again.\"\n\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you\n\ndo not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my\n\nasking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs.  Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with  ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.\"\n\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear\n\nher husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to  know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in  consequence of it, before THEY did. As the day of his arrival\n\ndrew near:\n\n\n\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her\n\nsister. \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\n\nindifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\n\ntalked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no  one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy  shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\n\n\"I wish I could say anything to comfort you,\" replied\n\nElizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\n\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance\n\nof servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the  period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long  as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before\n\ntheir invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.\n\nBut on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock\n\nand ride towards the house.\n \nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.\n\nJane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw  Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\n\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty;\n\n\"who can it be?\"\n\n\n\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am\n\nsure I do not know.\"\n \n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to\n\nbe with him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud\n\nman.\"\n \n\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well,\n\nany friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to\n\nbe sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\n\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore\n\nfelt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in\n\nseeing him almost for the first time after receiving his  explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.\n\nEach felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\n\nmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her\n\nresolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend,  without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had  sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane,\n\nto whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\n\nGardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had\n\nundervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he\n\nwas the person to whom the whole family were indebted for  the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\n\n\n\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just  as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming-\n\n-at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily\n\nseeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known\n\non first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.\n\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned\n\nfor half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of\n\ndelight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space\n\nof time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.\n\nBut she would not be secure.\n \n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then\n\nbe early enough for expectation.\"\n\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried\n\nthem to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching\n\nthe door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate  than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing,  her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable\n\nease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\n\nsymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\n\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\n\noften command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.\n\nHe looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had\n\nbeen used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him\n\n\n\nat Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's  presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\n\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\n\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility\n\nwhich made her two daughters ashamed, especially when\n\ncontrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her\n\ncurtsey and address to his friend.\n\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to\n\nthe latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\n\nirremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\n\ndegree by a distinction so ill applied.\n\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\n\ndid, a question which she could not answer without confusion,\n\nsaid scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that\n\nwas the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in\n\nDerbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could\n\nnot to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\n\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally,  unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to  his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself,\n\nand frequently on no object but the ground. More\n\nthoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last\n\n\n\nmet, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\n\nwith herself for being so.\n\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did\n\nhe come?\"\n \nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but\n\nhimself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\n\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said\n\nMrs. Bennet.\n \nHe readily agreed to it.\n\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.\n\nPeople DID say you meant to quit the place entirely at  Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went\n\naway. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own\n\ndaughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must  have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The  Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It\n\nwas only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia\n\nBennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother  Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\n\nmake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\n\n\n\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\n\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,\n\ntherefore, she could not tell.\n\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well\n\nmarried,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr.\n\nBingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.\n\nThey are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it\n\nseems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His  regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving  the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank\n\nHeaven! he has SOME friends, though perhaps not so many\n\nas he deserves.\"\n \nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\n\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which\n\nnothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked  Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at  present. A few weeks, he believed.\n\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\"\n\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many  as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be  vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the\n\ncovies for you.\"\n\nElizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at\n\n\n\npresent as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was  persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious\n\nconclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness\n\ncould not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such\n\npainful confusion.\n\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never\n\nmore to be in company with either of them. Their society can\n\nafford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as\n\nthis! Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\n\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer\n\nno compensation, received soon afterwards material relief,\n\nfrom observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled\n\nthe admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he\n\nhad spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to\n\nbe giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome\n\nas she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,  though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no  difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really\n\npersuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was\n\nso busily engaged, that she did not always know when she\n\nwas silent.\n \nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was\n\nmindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and\n\nengaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.\n\n\n\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added,\n\n\"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take\n\na family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not\n\nforgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much  disappointed that you did not come back and keep your  engagement.\"\n\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\n\nsomething of his concern at having been prevented by\n\nbusiness. They then went away.\n\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay\n\nand dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very\n\ngood table, she did not think anything less than two courses  could be good enough for a man on whom she had such  anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who\n\nhad ten thousand a year.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 54.\n\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.\n\nMr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.\n\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\n\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\n \nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\n\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\n\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears  me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why  silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about\n\nhim.\"\n \nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\n\nlook, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors,\n\nthan Elizabeth.\n \n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel  perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be  embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on\n\nTuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we\n\nmeet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly.\n\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\n \n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in\n\ndanger now?\"\n\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as\n\nmuch in love with you as ever.\"\n\n* * * * *\n \nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and  Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common\n\npoliteness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.\n\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at  Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very\n\ngood time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth\n\neagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place,  which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her  sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas,\n\nforbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room,\n\nhe seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and\n\nhappened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.\n\n\n\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\n\nfriend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\n\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\n\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\n\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.\n\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\n\nshowed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded\n\nthan formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to  himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily  secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence,\n\nshe yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\n\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she  was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from\n\nher as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her\n\nmother. She knew how little such a situation would give\n\npleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She  was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she  could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how\n\nformal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her\n\nmother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed  him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at  times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his\n\nkindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the\n\nfamily.\n\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the\n\n\n\nvisit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into  something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious\n\nsalutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the\n\nperiod which passed in the drawing-room, before the  gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that\n\nalmost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance\n\nas the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the\n\nevening must depend.\n\n\"If he does not come to me, THEN,\" said she, \"I shall give\n\nhim up for ever.\"\n\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he\n\nwould have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had  crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea,  and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a\n\nconfederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her\n\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's  approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever,  and said, in a whisper:\n\n\"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We\n\nwant none of them; do we?\"\n \nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he\n\nspoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to\n\ncoffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!\n\n\n\n\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be\n\nfoolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one\n\namong the sex, who would not protest against such a\n\nweakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is\n\nno indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\n\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\n\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\n\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\n\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\n \n\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on\n\nto Scarborough, these three weeks.\"\n\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by\n\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the\n\nyoung lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\n\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to\n\nbe soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown\n\nby seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist  players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the  party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were\n\n\n\nconfined for the evening at different tables, and she had  nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned\n\ntowards her side of the room, as to make him play as\n\nunsuccessfully as herself.\n\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered\n\nbefore any of the others, and she had no opportunity of\n\ndetaining them.\n\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to\n\nthemselves, \"What say you to the day? I think every thing has\n\npassed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as\n\nwell dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a  turn-and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The  soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases'\n\nlast week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the\n\npartridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has  two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never  saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I\n\nasked her whether you did not. And what do you think she\n\nsaid besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at\n\nNetherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty\n\nbehaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them\n\nprodigiously.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced\n\nthat she would get him at last; and her expectations of\n\nadvantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far  beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing  him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to\n\nElizabeth. \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.\"\n\nElizabeth smiled.\n \n\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It\n\nmortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his  conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without  having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what\n\nhis manners now are, that he never had any design of\n\nengaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with  greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of  generally pleasing, than any other man.\"\n\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me\n\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\n\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\n \n\"And how impossible in others!\"\n\n\n\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more\n\nthan I acknowledge?\"\n\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.\n\nWe all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 55.\n\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above\n\nan hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet\n\ninvited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of\n\nconcern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\n\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more\n\nlucky.\"\n\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\n\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\n\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.\n\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were\n\nnone of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's\n\nroom, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished,\n\ncrying out:\n\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--\n\nMr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste.\n\n\n\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair.\"\n\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I\n\ndare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up\n\nstairs half an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be\n\nquick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?\"\n\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be\n\nprevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.\n\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible\n\nagain in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the\n\nlibrary, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her  instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed,  Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and\n\nCatherine for a considerable time, without making any\n\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and  when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the  matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What\n\nam I to do?\"\n \n\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then  sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a  precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,\n\n\"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of\n\nthe room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke\n\n\n\nher distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that SHE  would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-\n\nopened the door and called out:\n\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\n\nElizabeth was forced to go.\n\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\"\n\nsaid her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I\n\nare going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.\"\n\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of\n\nsight, then returned into the drawing-room.\n\nMrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness\n\nrendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party;\n\nand he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother,  and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and  command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\n\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before\n\nhe went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his  own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to\n\nshoot with her husband.\n\n\n\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but\n\nElizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must\n\nspeedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the  stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded  that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's\n\nconcurrence.\n \nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.  Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter was much more agreeable than his companion\n\nexpected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in\n\nBingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\n\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric,\n\nthan the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned\n\nwith him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's\n\ninvention was again at work to get every body away from him  and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went  into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as\n\nthe others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\n\nwanted to counteract her mother's schemes.\n \nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to\n\nfear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On\n\nopening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley  standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest  conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\n\n\n\nboth, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\n\nother, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward\n\nenough; but HER'S she thought was still worse. Not a syllable\n\nwas uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going  away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat  down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her\n\nsister, ran out of the room.\n\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where\n\nconfidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her,  acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the\n\nhappiest creature in the world.\n\n\"'This too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not\n\ndeserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?\"\n\nElizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\n\nwarmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.\n\nEvery sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to  Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.\n\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not\n\non any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow  her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father  already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will\n\ngive such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so\n\nmuch happiness!\"\n\n\n\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely\n\nbroken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\n\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the\n\nrapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that  had given them so many previous months of suspense and\n\nvexation.\n \n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend's anxious\n\ncircumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!\n\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\n\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose\n\nconference with her father had been short and to the purpose.\n\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the\n\ndoor.\n \n\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment,\n\nI dare say.\"\n\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relation-\n\nship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her\n\nsister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his  own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his  being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of\n\nfelicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis\n\n\n\nthe excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of  Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her\n\nand himself.\n \nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet\n\nanimation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\n\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming\n\nsoon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her  approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,  though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour;\n\nand when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and\n\nmanner plainly showed how really happy he was.\n\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was\n\ngone, he turned to his daughter, and said:\n\n\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy\n\nwoman.\"\n \nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him\n\nfor his goodness.\n\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great  pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not  a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by\n\nno means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that\n\nnothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant\n\n\n\nwill cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed\n\nyour income.\"\n\n\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money\n\nmatters would be unpardonable in me.\"\n\n\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his\n\nwife, \"what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five\n\nthousand a year, and very likely more.\" Then addressing her\n\ndaughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I  shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I  always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be\n\nso beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw\n\nhim, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought  how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the  handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\n\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond\n\ncompetition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for  no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with  her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able\n\nto dispense.\n\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\n\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\n\nLongbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\n\nremaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\n\n\n\nneighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him  an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to\n\naccept.\n \nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\n\nsister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to  bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably\n\nuseful to both of them in those hours of separation that must\n\nsometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached  himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and  when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same\n\nmeans of relief.\n \n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by  telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town  last spring! I had not believed it possible.\"\n\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he\n\naccount for it?\"\n \n\"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly\n\nno friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot\n\nwonder at, since he might have chosen so much more\n\nadvantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust  they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn  to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though\n\nwe can never be what we once were to each other.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that\n\nI ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to\n\nsee you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.\"\n\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town  last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a  persuasion of MY being indifferent would have prevented his\n\ncoming down again!\"\n\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit\n\nof his modesty.\"\n\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\n\ndiffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\n\nqualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not  betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had  the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew\n\nit was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\n\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever  existed!\" cried Jane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from  my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see\n\nYOU as happy! If there WERE but such another man for\n\nyou!\"\n\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be\n\nso happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I\n\nnever can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for\n\n\n\nmyself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet\n\nwith another Mr. Collins in time.\"\n \nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not\n\nbe long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to  Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do  the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\n\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest\n\nfamily in the world, though only a few weeks before, when  Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to\n\nbe marked out for misfortune.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 56.\n\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement\n\nwith Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the\n\nfamily were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention\n\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a\n\ncarriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the  lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides,  the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\n\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\n\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it  was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley  instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement\n\nof such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\n\nshrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the  remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till  the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was\n\nLady Catherine de Bourgh.\n\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of  Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\n\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\n\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a\n\nword. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her\n\n\n\nladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had\n\nbeen made.\n \nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\n\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost  politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very  stiffly to Elizabeth, \"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That\n\nlady, I suppose, is your mother.\"\n\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n\n\"And THAT I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a\n\nLady Catherine. \"She is my youngest girl but one. My\n\nyoungest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere  about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe,  will soon become a part of the family.\"\n\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady\n\nCatherine after a short silence.\n \n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare\n\nsay; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William\n\nLucas's.\"\n \n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the\n\nevening, in summer; the windows are full west.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after\n\ndinner, and then added:\n \n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether\n\nyou left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\n\n\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\n\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\n\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\n\nher calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely\n\npuzzled.\n\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to\n\ntake some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely,\n\nand not very politely, declined eating anything; and then,\n\nrising up, said to Elizabeth,\n\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\n\nwilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a\n\nturn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\n\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and show her ladyship\n\nabout the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the\n\nhermitage.\"\n\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\n\n\n\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them,\n\nafter a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\n\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that\n\nher waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along  the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was\n\ndetermined to make no effort for conversation with a woman\n\nwho was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.\n\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as\n\nshe looked in her face.\n \nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began\n\nin the following manner:-\n\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the\n\nreason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own\n\nconscience, must tell you why I come.\"\n\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n \n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all\n\nable to account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\n\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you\n\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however\n\ninsincere YOU may choose to be, you shall not find ME so.  My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\n\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\n\n\n\ncertainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming  nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\n\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\n\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all  likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own  nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I KNOW it must be a scandalous\n\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to\n\nsuppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting  off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to  you.\"\n\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth,\n\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took  the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship  propose by it?\"\n\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally\n\ncontradicted.\"\n \n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\"\n\nsaid Elizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\n\nindeed, such a report is in existence.\"\n\n\"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not  been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know  that such a report is spread abroad?\"\n\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\n\n\n\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\n\nfor it?\"\n \n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your\n\nladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to\n\nanswer.\"\n \n\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being\n\nsatisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\n\nmarriage?\"\n\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\n\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\n\nhis reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of\n\ninfatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\n\nand to all his family. You may have drawn him in.\"\n\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\n\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been\n\naccustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest\n\nrelation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his\n\ndearest concerns.\"\n \n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such\n\nbehaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you\n\nhave the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No,\n\nnever. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have\n\nyou to say?\"\n\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to\n\nsuppose he will make an offer to me.\"\n\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\n\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From\n\ntheir infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was\n\nthe favourite wish of HIS mother, as well as of her's. While in\n\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\n\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in  their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior  birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\n\nthe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\n\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\n\ncousin?\"\n \n\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If\n\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I  shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother\n\nand aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did\n\nas much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion  depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor\n\n\n\ninclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make  another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept\n\nhim?\"\n \n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid  it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed  by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\n\ninclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and\n\ndespised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will  be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\n\nof us.\"\n \n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the\n\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of  happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could,  upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\n\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this\n\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing\n\ndue to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to\n\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the\n\ndetermined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be\n\ndissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any  person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking  disappointment.\"\n\n\"THAT will make your ladyship's situation at present more\n\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter\n\nand my nephew are formed for each other. They are\n\ndescended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line;\n\nand, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and  ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on both sides  is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\n\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide\n\nthem? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without  family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it  must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good,\n\nyou would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been\n\nbrought up.\"\n\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\n\nquitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's\n\ndaughter; so far we are equal.\"\n\n\"True. You ARE a gentleman's daughter. But who was  your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine  me ignorant of their condition.\"\n\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if\n\nyour nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to\n\nYOU.\"\n \n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\n\n\n\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she\n\ncould not but say, after a moment's deliberation:\n\n\"I am not.\"\n \nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\n\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\n\nengagement?\"\n\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\n\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to\n\nfind a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive\n\nyour self into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go\n\naway till you have given me the assurance I require.\"\n\n\"And I certainly NEVER shall give it. I am not to be\n\nintimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your\n\nladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would\n\nmy giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at  all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me,  would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to\n\nbestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine,\n\nthat the arguments with which you have supported this  extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the  application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\n\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions\n\n\n\nas these. How far your nephew might approve of your  interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly\n\nno right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to\n\nbe importuned no farther on the subject.\"\n\n\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To\n\nall the objections I have already urged, I have still another to\n\nadd. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest\n\nsister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young  man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence  of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my\n\nnephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's\n\nsteward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are\n\nyou thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus\n\npolluted?\"\n\n\"You can now have nothing further to say,\" she resentfully\n\nanswered. \"You have insulted me in every possible method. I\n\nmust beg to return to the house.\"\n\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and\n\nthey turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\n\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my  nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a  connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\n\neverybody?\"\n\n\n\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know\n\nmy sentiments.\"\n\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\n \n\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that  manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my  happiness, without reference to YOU, or to any person so\n\nwholly unconnected with me.\"\n\n\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to  obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are  determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and\n\nmake him the contempt of the world.\"\n\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied  Elizabeth, \"have any possible claim on me, in the present  instance. No principle of either would be violated by my\n\nmarriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment\n\nof his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former  WERE excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one\n\nmoment's concern -and the world in general would have too\n\nmuch sense to join in the scorn.\"\n\n\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve!  Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss  Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try\n\nyou. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I\n\nwill carry my point.\"\n\n\n\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she\n\nadded, \"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no\n\ncompliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I\n\nam most seriously displeased.\"\n\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to\n\npersuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly\n\ninto it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she  proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the  door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would\n\nnot come in again and rest herself.\n\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\n\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here\n\nwas prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\n\nthe Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare\n\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as  well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to  you, Lizzy?\"\n\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\n\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\n\nimpossible.\n\n\n\nChapter 57.\n\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.\n\nLady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of\n\nthis journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking  off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a  rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their\n\nengagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\n\nimagine; till she recollected that HIS being the intimate friend  of Bingley, and HER being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a  time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody\n\neager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself\n\nforgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring  them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas  Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the\n\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\n\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\n\nsome future time.\n \nIn revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she\n\ncould not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible  consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what  she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it\n\noccurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to\n\nher nephew; and how HE might take a similar representation\n\n\n\nof the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not\n\npronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for\n\nhis aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was\n\nnatural to suppose that he thought much higher of her  ladyship than SHE could do; and it was certain that, in  enumerating the miseries of a marriage with ONE, whose\n\nimmediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt\n\nwould address him on his weakest side. With his notions of\n\ndignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to  Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much\n\ngood sense and solid reasoning.\n\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at\n\nonce to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.\n\nIn that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to  Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\n\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise\n\nshould come to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I  shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every  expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied\n\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\n\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\n\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\n\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.\n\nBennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\n\nThe next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was\n\nmet by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in\n\nhis hand.\n \n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into\n\nmy room.\"\n\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what\n\nhe had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its  being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It  suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and\n\nshe anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\n\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\n\ndown. He then said,\n \n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished\n\nme exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you\n\nought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had  two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate  you on a very important conquest.\"\n\n\n\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the\n\ninstantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\n\ninstead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most\n\nto be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that\n\nhis letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\n\ncontinued:\n \n\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration\n\nin such matters as these; but I think I may defy even YOUR  sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is\n\nfrom Mr. Collins.\"\n \n\"From Mr. Collins! and what can HE have to say?\"\n\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins  with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest  daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\n\ngood-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your\n\nimpatience, by reading what he says on that point. What  relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the  sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this\n\nhappy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of\n\nanother; of which we have been advertised by the same  authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not  long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has\n\nresigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\n\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\n\npersonages in this land.'\n\n\n\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"\n\n'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with\n\nevery thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid\n\nproperty, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite  of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and  yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\n\nwith this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\n\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.'\n\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But\n\nnow it comes out:\n \n\"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have\n\nreason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\n\ndoes not look on the match with a friendly eye.'\n\n\"MR. DARCY, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I\n\nHAVE surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\n\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name  would have given the lie more effectually to what they  related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see\n\na blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It\n\nis admirable!\"\n \nElizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been\n\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.\n\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\n\n\"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\n\nladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\n\ncondescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when  it become apparent, that on the score of some family  objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\n\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it\n\nmy duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my  cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what  they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has\n\nnot been properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I\n\nam truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has  been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their  living together before the marriage took place should be so\n\ngenerally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of\n\nmy station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at  hearing that you received the young couple into your house as  soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice;\n\nand had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very\n\nstrenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive  them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or  allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his\n\nnotion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only\n\nabout his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a  young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not  enjoy it. You are not going to be MISSISH, I hope, and\n\npretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live,\n\n\n\nbut to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\n\nturn?\"\n \n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is\n\nso strange!\"\n\n\"Yes--THAT is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on\n\nany other man it would have been nothing; but HIS perfect\n\nindifference, and YOUR pointed dislike, make it so\n\ndelightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not  give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration.  Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the\n\npreference even over Wickham, much as I value the\n\nimpudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy,  what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to\n\nrefuse her consent?\"\n \nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh;\n\nand as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was  not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been  more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\n\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\n\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of  Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps,\n\ninstead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too\n\nmuch.\n\n\n\nChapter 58.\n\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days\n\nhad passed after Lady Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived\n\nearly; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their  having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary  dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\n\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in\n\nthe habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the  remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however,  soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind,\n\nwhile Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\n\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\n\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to\n\ncall upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making  it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on\n\nwith him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be\n\nexecuted, and, while her courage was high, she immediately\n\nsaid:\n \n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake\n\nof giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may\n\nbe wounding your's. I can no longer help thanking you for\n\nyour unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I\n\n\n\nhave known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to  you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my\n\nfamily, I should not have merely my own gratitude to\n\nexpress.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of\n\nsurprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of\n\nwhat may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I\n\ndid not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\n \n\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness\n\nfirst betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the\n\nmatter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the\n\nparticulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of  all my family, for that generous compassion which induced  you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications,\n\nfor the sake of discovering them.\"\n\n\"If you WILL thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself\n\nalone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add\n\nforce to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not\n\nattempt to deny. But your FAMILY owe me nothing. Much as\n\nI respect them, I believe I thought only of YOU.\"\n\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to\n\ntrifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last\n\nApril, tell me so at once. MY affections and wishes are\n\n\n\nunchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this\n\nsubject for ever.\"\n\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness\n\nand anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and  immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to  understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a\n\nchange, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her\n\nreceive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had  probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the\n\noccasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love\n\ncan be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter  his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of  heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but,\n\nthough she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\n\nfeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to\n\nhim, made his affection every moment more valuable.\n\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There\n\nwas too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to\n\nany other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for  their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt,  who did call on him in her return through London, and there\n\nrelate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance\n\nof her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on  every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's  apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and\n\n\n\nassurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her\n\nendeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she\n\nhad refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect\n\nhad been exactly contrariwise.\n\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever al\n\nlowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your\n\ndisposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely,\n\nirrevocably   decided   against   me,   you   would   have\n\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\n\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you\n\nknow enough of my frankness to believe me capable of\n\nTHAT. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\n\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For,\n\nthough your accusations were ill-founded, formed on\n\nmistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had  merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot\n\nthink of it without abhorrence.\"\n \n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame\n\nannexed to that evening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of  neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since  then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\n\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The\n\nrecollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners,\n\n\n\nmy expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been  many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so\n\nwell applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more\n\ngentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know  not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;-though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable\n\nenough to allow their justice.\"\n\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so  strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being  ever felt in such a way.\"\n\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of\n\nevery proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your  countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not  have addressed you in any possible way that would induce\n\nyou to accept me.\"\n\n\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections  will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most  heartily ashamed of it.\"\n\nDarcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon\n\nmake you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any\n\ncredit to its contents?\"\n \nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how\n\ngradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\n\n\n\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain,\n\nbut it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter.\n\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I\n\nshould dread your having the power of reading again. I can  remember some expressions which might justly make you\n\nhate me.\"\n \n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it\n\nessential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we  have both reason to think my opinions not entirely  unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as\n\nthat implies.\"\n\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed my self perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it  was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\n\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end\n\nso. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who  received it, are now so widely different from what they were\n\nthen, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to\n\nbe forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think\n\nonly of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\n\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\n\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that\n\nthe contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,\n\nwhat is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so.\n\n\n\nPainful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in\n\npractice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what\n\nwas right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was  given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and  conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only\n\nchild), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good\n\nthemselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent  and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be  selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own\n\nfamily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to\n\nwish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth  compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and  twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,\n\nloveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a\n\nlesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I  was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my  reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\n\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\n\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\n\n\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I\n\nbelieved you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\n\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not\n\nintentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but\n\n\n\nmy spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have\n\nhated me after THAT evening?\"\n\n\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon\n\nbegan to take a proper direction.\"\n\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me,\n\nwhen we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\n\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\n\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than MINE in being  noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no  extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to\n\nreceive MORE than my due.\"\n\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to show you, by  every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent  the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen\n\nyour ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had\n\nbeen at tended to. How soon any other wishes introduced  themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an  hour after I had seen you.\"\n\nHe then told her of Georgiana's delight in her\n\nacquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden  interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that  interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following\n\nher from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\n\n\n\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and  thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than\n\nwhat such a purpose must comprehend.\n\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\n\nsubject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\n\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too\n\nbusy to know anything about it, they found at last, on\n\nexamining their watches, that it was time to be at home.\n\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a\n\nwonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy\n\nwas delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him\n\nthe earliest information of it.\n \n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon\n\nhappen.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed  as much.\" And though he exclaimed at the term, she found  that it had been pretty much the case.\n\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I\n\nmade a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have  made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my  former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His\n\n\n\nsurprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I  told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in\n\nsupposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to\n\nhim; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her\n\nwas unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\n\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of\n\ndirecting his friend.\n\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she,  \"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from  my information last spring?\"\n\n\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the\n\ntwo visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced\n\nof her affection.\"\n \n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\n\nconviction to him.\"\n \n\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His  diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment  in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every\n\nthing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a\n\ntime, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself  to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last  winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.\n\nHe was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer\n\n\n\nthan he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He\n\nhas heartily forgiven me now.\"\n\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a\n\nmost delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\n\ninvaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he\n\nhad yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to\n\nbegin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of\n\ncourse was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the  conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they  parted.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 59.\n\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\"  was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as  she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat\n\ndown to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had\n\nwandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She  coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else,  awakened a suspicion of the truth.\n\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything\n\nextraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed,  the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a  disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and\n\nElizabeth, agitated and confused, rather KNEW that she was\n\nhappy than FELT herself to be so; for, besides the immediate\n\nembarrassment, there were other evils before her. She\n\nanticipated what would be felt in the family when her\n\nsituation became known; she was aware that no one liked him\n\nbut Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike\n\nwhich not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\n\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion\n\nwas very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was\n\nabsolutely incredulous here.\n\n\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr.\n\nDarcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be\n\nimpossible.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence\n\nwas on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you\n\ndo not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the\n\ntruth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\n\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I\n\nknow how much you dislike him.\"\n\n\"You know nothing of the matter. THAT is all to be\n\nforgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\n\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again,\n\nand more seriously assured her of its truth.\n\n\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe\n\nyou,\" cried Jane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do\n\ncongratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question --\n\nare you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us\n\nalready, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But\n\nare you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\n\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or  myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as  impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough?\n\n\n\nOh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection.\n\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel MORE than I ought to\n\ndo, when I tell you all.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do\n\nBingley. I am afraid you will be angry.\"\n\n\"My dearest sister, now BE serious. I want to talk very  seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without  delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\n\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know\n\nwhen it began. But I believe I must date it from my first\n\nseeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\n\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however,\n\nproduced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her\n\nsolemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that\n\narticle, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.\n\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as\n\nhappy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for\n\nnothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed  him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can  be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you\n\n\n\nhave been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you  tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all\n\nthat I know of it to another, not to you.\"\n\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his\n\nfriend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his\n\nshare in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the\n\nnight spent in conversation.\n\n* * * * *\n \n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a\n\nwindow the next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is  not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he  mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had\n\nno notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other,\n\nand not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with  him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may  not be in Bingley's way.\"\n\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a\n\nproposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be\n\nalways giving him such an epithet.\n\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so\n\nexpressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no\n\ndoubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said\n\n\n\naloud, \"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in\n\nwhich Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\n\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs.\n\nBennet, \"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\n\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley;\n\n\"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?\"\n\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and  Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get\n\nready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:\n\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have  that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not  mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no\n\noccasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do\n\nnot put yourself to inconvenience.\"\n\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.\n\nElizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.\n\nShe could not determine how her mother would take it;\n\nsometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur  would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But\n\nwhether she were violently set against the match, or violently\n\ndelighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be  equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no\n\n\n\nmore bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her\n\njoy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.\n\n* * * * *\n \nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her\n\nfather's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and\n\nthat it should be through her means--that SHE, his favourite  child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be  filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a\n\nwretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy\n\nappeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved  by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where  she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her\n\nwork said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in\n\nthe library.\" She was gone directly.\n\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out\n\nof your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always\n\nhated him?\"\n \nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It\n\nwould have spared her from explanations and professions\n\nwhich it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now\n\n\n\nnecessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her\n\nattachment to Mr. Darcy.\n\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is\n\nrich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine\n\ncarriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?\"\n\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your\n\nbelief of my indifference?\"\n\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant\n\nsort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked\n\nhim.\"\n \n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I\n\nlove him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly  amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not  pain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\n\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He\n\nis the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse\n\nanything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to  YOU, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise\n\nyou to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I\n\nknow that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless  you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to  him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\n\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely\n\nescape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the\n\n\n\ngrief of seeing YOU unable to respect your partner in life.\n\nYou know not what you are about.\"\n\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in\n\nher reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.  Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the  gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone,\n\nrelating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the\n\nwork of a day, but had stood the test of many months  suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,  she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to\n\nthe match.\n \n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I  have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I  could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less\n\nworthy.\"\n\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her\n\nwith astonishment.\n \n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did\n\nevery thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the  fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the bet ter. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it\n\nbeen your uncle's doing, I must and WOULD have paid him;\n\nbut these violent young lovers carry every thing their own  way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and\n\n\n\nstorm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the\n\nmatter.\"\n \nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before,\n\non his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her  some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the  room, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them\n\nin, for I am quite at leisure.\"\n\nElizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable\n\ncomposure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the\n\nevening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything  material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\n\nwould come in time.\n \nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night,\n\nshe followed her, and made the important communication. Its  effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.  Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it\n\nunder many, many minutes that she could comprehend what\n\nshe heard; though not in general backward to credit what was  for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a  lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget\n\nabout in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless\n\nherself.\n\n\n\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr.\n\nDarcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh!\n\nmy sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What\n\npin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's  is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so pleased--so happy.  Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear\n\nLizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much\n\nbefore. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house  in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters  married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of\n\nme. I shall go distracted.\"\n\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had\n\nbeen three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\n\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else!  Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a  Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married\n\nby a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish\n\nMr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-\n\nmorrow.\"\n \nThis was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the\n\ngentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though\n\nin the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure  of her relations' consent, there was still something to be\n\n\n\nwished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she  expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her\n\nintended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him,\n\nunless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\n\nher deference for his opinion.\n\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking\n\npains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon\n\nassured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\n\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he.\n\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like\n\nYOUR husband quite as well as Jane's.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 60.\n\nElizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \"How could you begin?\" said she. \"I can\n\ncomprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once\n\nmade a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\n\nplace?\"\n\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\n\nwords, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in\n\nthe middle before I knew that I HAD begun.\"\n\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my\n\nmanners--my behaviour to YOU was at least always bordering\n\non the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather\n\nwishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you\n\nadmire me for my impertinence?\"\n\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\n\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very\n\nlittle less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of  deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the  women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking\n\nfor YOUR approbation alone. I roused, and interested you,\n\nbecause I was so unlike THEM. Had you not been really  amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the  pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always\n\n\n\nnoble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the  persons who so assiduously courted you. There--I have saved\n\nyou the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things\n\nconsidered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be  sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of  THAT when they fall in love.\"\n\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane\n\nwhile she was ill at Netherfield?\"\n \n\"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But\n\nmake a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under\n\nyour protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as\n\npossible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for  teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I  shall begin directly by asking you what made you so\n\nunwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy\n\nof me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why,  especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not\n\ncare about me?\"\n \n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\n\nencouragement.\"\n\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\n \n\"And so was I.\"\n\n\n\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to\n\ndinner.\"\n \n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\n\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to  give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I  wonder how long you WOULD have gone on, if you had been\n\nleft to yourself. I wonder when you WOULD have spoken, if I\n\nhad not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your  kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. TOO MUCH, I\n\nam afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\n\nsprings from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have\n\nmentioned the subject. This will never do.\"\n\n\"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be\n\nperfectly fair. Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to\n\nseparate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am\n\nnot indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of  expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for  any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me\n\nhope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\"\n\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to  make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what  did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride\n\nto Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any\n\nmore serious consequence?\"\n\n\n\n\"My real purpose was to see YOU, and to judge, if I could,\n\nwhether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed\n\none, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your\n\nsister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the\n\nconfession to him which I have since made.\"\n \n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady\n\nCatherine what is to befall her?\"\n \n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage,  Elizabeth. But it ought to done, and if you will give me a  sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.\"\n\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\n\nand admire the evenness of your writing, as another young  lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer  neglected.\"\n\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy\n\nwith Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet  answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having THAT\n\nto communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she\n\nwas almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had\n\nalready lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\n\nfollows:\n \n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I\n\nought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\n\nparticulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You\n\n\n\nsupposed more than really existed. But NOW suppose as  much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge\n\nyour imagination in every possible flight which the subject\n\nwill afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you  cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise  him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you,\n\nagain and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so\n\nsilly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We  will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in  the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not\n\none with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only\n\nsmiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world  that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley\n\nat Christmas. Yours, etc.\"\n \nMr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different\n\nstyle; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent\n\nto Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.\n\n\"DEAR SIR,\n \n\"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.\n\nElizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady  Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.\n\n\"Yours sincerely, etc.\"\n\n\n\nMiss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and\n\ninsincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express\n\nher delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.  Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though  feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much\n\nkinder answer than she knew was deserved.\n \nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and\n\nall her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\n\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to\n\nLucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon\n\nevident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly  angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte,  really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the\n\nstorm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her\n\nfriend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the  course of their meetings she must sometimes think the  pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to\n\nall the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He\n\nbore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\n\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on  carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and\n\n\n\nexpressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St.  James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his\n\nshoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\n\nMrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with\n\nthe familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet,\n\nwhenever she DID speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her  respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to  make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield\n\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious\n\nto keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom  he might converse without mortification; and though the  uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the\n\nseason of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope\n\nof the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time  when they should be removed from society so little pleasing  to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\n\nat Pemberley.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 61.\n\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which  Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.  With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.\n\nBingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I\n\ncould say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment  of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her  children produced so happy an effect as to make her a\n\nsensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her\n\nlife; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might  not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that  she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.\n\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his\n\naffection for her drew him oftener from home than anything  else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially  when he was least expected.\n\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a\n\ntwelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton  relations was not desirable even to HIS easy temper, or HER  affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then\n\ngratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to\n\nDerbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\n\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\n\ntime with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what\n\n\n\nshe had generally known, her improvement was great. She  was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed\n\nfrom the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper\n\nattention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and  less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society  she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\n\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\n\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never\n\nconsent to her going.\n\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and\n\nshe   was   necessarily   drawn   from   the   pursuit   of\n\naccomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit  alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she  could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was\n\nno longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters'\n\nbeauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she\n\nsubmitted to the change without much reluctance.\n\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no\n\nrevolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with\n\nphilosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become  acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had  before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was\n\nnot wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\n\nto make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth  received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by\n\n\n\nhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.\n\nThe letter was to this effect:\n \n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\n\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do  my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great  comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else\n\nto do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would\n\nlike a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall  have quite money enough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year;\n\nbut however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had\n\nrather not.\n \n\"Yours, etc.\"\n \nAs it happened that Elizabeth had MUCH rather not, she\n\nendeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and\n\nexpectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her  power to afford, by the practice of what might be called  economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent\n\nthem. It had always been evident to her that such an income as\n\ntheirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in  their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very  insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their\n\nquarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to\n\nfor some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their  manner of living, even when the restoration of peace\n\n\n\ndismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They  were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap\n\nsituation, and always spending more than they ought. His\n\naffection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a\n\nlittle longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she  retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had\n\ngiven her.\n\nThough Darcy could never receive HIM at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession.  Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was\n\ngone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the\n\nBingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even  Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\n\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's\n\nmarriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of  visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder  than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as\n\nheretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\n\nPemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended.\n\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;\n\nthough at first she often listened with an astonishment  bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to\n\n\n\nher brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect  which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object\n\nof open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had\n\nnever before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she  began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with  her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister\n\nmore than ten years younger than himself.\n\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which\n\nannounced its arrangement, she sent him language so very\n\nabusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all  intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's  persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and\n\nseek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on\n\nthe part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her  affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife\n\nconducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at\n\nPemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\n\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but\n\nthe visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\n\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate\n\nterms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they\n\nwere both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the  persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the  means of uniting them.\n\n\n\nMore classics here:\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n   \n -  page-1 \n -  page-16 \n -  page-31 \n -  page-46 \n -  page-61 \n -  page-76 \n -  page-91 \n -  page-106 \n -  page-121 \n -  page-136 \n -  page-151 \n -  page-166 \n -  page-181 \n -  page-196 \n -  page-211 \n -  page-226 \n -  page-241 \n -  page-256 \n -  page-271 \n -  page-286 \n -  page-301 \n -  page-316 \n -  page-331 \n -  page-346 \n -  page-361 \n -  page-376 \n -  page-391 \n -  page-406 \n -  page-421 \n -  page-436 \n -  page-451 \n -  page-466 \n -  page-481 \n -  page-496 \n -  page-511 \n -  page-526", "supersummary": {"overview": "Published anonymously in 1813 by English author Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is an example of a “novel of manners,” which presents a realistic picture of society through the customs and manners of everyday life. By depicting complex relationships between landowners and tradesmen, those with old money and the nouveaux riche, and men and women, Pride and Prejudice offers a glimpse into the social structures of early 19th-century England. The novel’s primary focus is marriage, specifically in its capacity as the most practical way for women of small fortune to ensure their financial security. It touches on how property laws make women dependent on male relations and on the narrow standards for women’s behavior. It also comments on the complicated social hierarchy revolving around land ownership and etiquette. Many characters in Pride and Prejudice seek to make themselves appear socially superior and to ingratiate themselves to the wealthy; the novel, however, argues that true good breeding entails integrity, kindness, and humility.", "summary": "Mrs. Bennet hopes Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young bachelor who has just moved to a large nearby estate called Netherfield, will marry one of her five daughters. The Bennet family meets Bingley and his party at a ball in the town of Meryton. Bingley is amiable and friendly, and he and Jane, the oldest daughter, form an instant attachment. His sisters, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, are haughty and superior. Mr. Darcy, a friend of Mr. Bingley’s, refuses to dance with anyone outside his party. At one point, Elizabeth, the second daughter of the Bennet family, overhears Darcy sneering that she is not attractive enough for him.\nJane and Bingley’s affection grows over time. Meanwhile, Darcy becomes begrudgingly attracted to Elizabeth. When Jane falls ill while visiting the Bingley sisters at Netherfield and is forced to stay several nights, Elizabeth is invited to stay with Jane. The Bingley sisters mock Elizabeth and Jane behind their backs, joking about the inferior social status of their relatives. Each night, Darcy and Elizabeth engage in witty banter, verbally sparing over a variety of topics. With every conversation, Darcy is more and more entranced by her intelligence. His attraction to Elizabeth frustrates Miss Bingley, who wants to marry him herself.\nAs he has no sons, Mr. Bennet’s estate, Longbourn, has been entailed to his cousin, Mr. Collins, who will inherit it after Mr. Bennet’s death. Mr. Collins, an obtuse, pompous clergyman, visits Longbourn, to meet the family. Mrs. Bennet is thrilled when she learns that Mr. Collins intends to marry one of her daughters because it will ensure Longbourn remain in her family.\nThe Bennet daughters enjoy going to Meryton, where a regiment of officers is stationed. There, they meet the handsome Mr. Wickham, who charms Elizabeth. Elizabeth is incensed by Wickham’s report that his father was Darcy’s father’s steward and that Darcy defied his father’s will by preventing Wickham from receiving a living in the clergy.\nAt a ball held at Netherfield, Elizabeth is surprised when Darcy asks her to dance. When she confronts him about having injured Wickham, Darcy suggests Wickham’s character isn’t what it appears. Throughout the night, her family’s brash behavior mortifies Elizabeth. The next day, Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth, and she vehemently declines, infuriating Mrs. Bennet.\nJane receives a letter from Miss Bingley stating that the whole party has left Netherfield for London and that she hopes Bingley will marry Darcy’s sister. Jane is disappointed, stating she must have misunderstood Bingley’s feelings; Elizabeth is livid, believing Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst think Jane isn’t good enough for their brother.\nWhen Elizabeth’s best friend, Charlotte Lucas, accepts a proposal from Mr. Collins, Elizabeth is disappointed in Charlotte for settling in a marriage that could never make her happy. Charlotte, a plain woman of small fortune, assures her she seeks only financial security in marriage. After Charlotte and Mr. Collins marry, Elizabeth visits them at Hunsford. Mr. Collins is delighted to introduce Elizabeth to his haughty patron Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who happens to be Darcy’s aunt. Soon, Darcy arrives with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. During his stay, Darcy goes to great lengths to see Elizabeth.\nElizabeth is infuriated when Colonel Fitzwilliam reveals that Darcy intervened in Bingley and Jane’s romance. Later that day, Darcy visits Elizabeth, confesses his love, spells out his objections to her family, and asks for her hand in marriage. Disgusted, she rejects him, citing his insults to her family, his role in Jane’s unhappiness, and his ill treatment of Wickham. Stunned and angry, he leaves.\nThe next day, Darcy gives her a letter, in which he explains that he interfered in Bingley and Jane’s relationship because he believed Jane’s affection didn’t match Bingley’s. He also relates that Wickham turned down the living in the clergy and squandered his money, then attempted to elope with Darcy’s young sister. Elizabeth realizes Darcy is telling the truth and that she’s exhibited the same prejudice she’s accused him of.\nBack home, Lydia, the flirtatious youngest Bennet daughter, goes with friends to Brighton, where the officers are now stationed. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, take a trip to Derbyshire, where Darcy’s estate, Pemberley, is situated. At Pemberley, they meet Darcy’s housekeeper, who shares stories of his kindness and generosity. Reeling from this information, they explore the beautiful grounds until they encounter Darcy himself, who has come home earlier than expected. Elizabeth notices that his manner is gentler: he’s kind to her aunt and uncle, and he asks to introduce her to his sister. Darcy, his sister, and Bingley visit the next morning. Elizabeth likes Miss Darcy instantly and is happy that Bingley still loves Jane. She finds herself feeling more and more warmly toward Darcy.\nWhen Elizabeth receives a letter from Jane informing her that Lydia has run away with Wickham, she is forced to confess the news to Darcy. She returns home, lamenting that he could never love her now. Mr. Gardiner goes to London to find Lydia and Wickham; the family hopes to make the couple marry to avoid the shame of them living together out of wedlock. After the wedding, Elizabeth learns Darcy paid Wickham’s large debts to convince him to marry Lydia. She is overwhelmed by his kindness and hopes he did it for her.\nBingley and Darcy return to Netherfield, and Bingley proposes to Jane. One day, Elizabeth is surprised to receive a visit from Lady Catherine, who says she’s heard that Elizabeth is going to marry Darcy and demands that she promise never to do so. Elizabeth refuses to make this promise. When Elizabeth next sees Darcy at Longbourn, she thanks him for helping Lydia, and the two confess their love. Darcy explains how he’d taken her criticism to heart and how his hope was revived when Lady Catherine told him Elizabeth had refused to promise she wouldn’t marry him.\nOnce married, Elizabeth is glad to move to Pemberley, especially once Jane and Bingley move to an estate nearby. Lydia frequently appeals to Jane and Elizabeth for money. Miss Darcy lives at Pemberley, and she and Elizabeth become good friends. Elizabeth enjoys visits from Mr. Bennet and the Gardiners.", "url": "https://www.supersummary.com/pride-and-prejudice/", "author": "Jane Austen", "characters": {"Elizabeth Bennet": "As the protagonist of Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth has the most complex journey. Her observation is keen and her wit sharp, making her arguably Mr. Bennet’s favorite, a respite from his “silly and ignorant” (7) other daughters. She has “a lively, playful disposition” (13) and is “not formed for ill-humour [sic]” (87); she laughs off Darcy’s comment to Bingley that she is merely “tolerable” (13), and she quickly overcomes her sorrow when Wickham is absent from the Netherfield ball. When she is unable to convince her father to forbid Lydia from going to Brighton, she decides not “to fret over unavoidable evils,” for “[i]t [is] not in her nature […] to increase her vexations by dwelling on them” (217). Her evenness of temper establishes her as dependable and rational, highlighting her grave error in relying on her emotions when judging Darcy and Wickham, the charismatic solider posted in the nearby town of Meryton.As the two oldest Bennet daughters, Jane and Elizabeth have a particularly close relationship. However, Elizabeth has “more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister” (16), making her more likely to question people’s motives, often seeing truths Jane does not. Unlike Jane, who sees nothing but the good in people, Elizabeth easily sees through the Bingley sisters’ false charm, recognizing their attempts to keep Jane and Bingley apart even when Jane believes their separation is the result of innocent misunderstandings. Keenly attuned to tone and skillful at reading between the lines, Elizabeth senses Mr. Collins’s ridiculousness from his letter, asking her father if he can “be a sensible man” (62). Elizabeth is equally incisive about herself as she is about others. She is willing to concede to Mrs. Gardiner “the imprudence” (139) of pursuing a relationship with Wickham; later, when Wickham pursues a wealthier young lady, Miss King, her lack of pain inspires Elizabeth to acknowledge that she was not, in fact, “much in love” (144). Elizabeth’s ability to parse people’s meanings and motivations makes her failure to correctly assess Wickham’s character all the more remarkable.Elizabeth expects to be treated as “a rational creature” rather than a modest, “elegant female” (105)—or worse, a husband’s property. Early in the novel, her point of view is contrasted with that of Charlotte Lucas, who believes women in financial straits do not have the luxury of falling in love. Elizabeth expects more: she disagrees that marriage’s sole purpose is convenience and is grossly disappointed when Charlotte accepts Mr. Collins’s proposal. She finds “humiliating” the picture of Charlotte “disgracing herself” (120), believing her to have sacrificed common sense and happiness for mere material gain. She herself ultimately marries for love, proving that despite the unfortunate marriages around her, one need not settle for mediocrity. Elizabeth expects to be a partner in her marriage—she shocks Darcy’s young sister by teasing him as an equal—thus shattering societal expectations that wives, in Mr. Collins’s words, should not be “headstrong” lest they negatively impact the “happiness in the marriage state” (106).Despite her strong opinions, Elizabeth shows willingness to grow and learn by overcoming her prejudice of Darcy and acknowledging that she’d misinterpreted his character. Already predisposed to dislike Darcy, she believes everything Wickham tells her about him, finding Wickham too handsome to lie and falling victim to the same prejudice of which she accuses Darcy. She confronts Darcy over Wickham without ever hearing his side of the story, rejecting his proposal in part because of what she believes he’s done to Wickham. She reads Darcy’s letter “[w]ith a strong prejudice against everything he might say” (192) and at first is angry over his assessment of Jane and her family; however, a careful, rational reading of his letter forces her to acknowledge her how her previous thinking had been faulty, ultimately leading her to reevaluate her opinions. She is horrified to discover her own vanity and prejudices, acknowledging that she “never knew myself” (196) and absorbing the lesson, which is “humiliating” but “just” (196). Over the months that follow, she realizes the extent of her misconception, taking seriously the warm commendations of Darcy’s servant Mrs. Reynolds and considering the kindness he’s exhibited toward his sister. Her reevaluation of his character makes her newly nervous around him, especially as she comes to understand that he is, in fact, “exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her” (289). The gradual softening of her feelings toward him shows an open-mindedness that earns her happiness when he proposes a second time.", "Fitzwilliam Darcy": "The people of Meryton dislike Darcy almost immediately after he arrives at Netherfield. At the Meryton ball, people are impressed with his “handsome features, noble mien, and the report […] of his having ten thousand a year” (12), until his manners are determined to be proud. Unlike his friend Bingley, he doesn’t speak to or dance with anyone outside his party. By the end of the evening, the town has decided that “[h]e [is] the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world” (12). It’s also at the Meryton ball that he insults Elizabeth, telling Bingley, loudly enough for her to hear, that he finds her merely “tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me” (13).The more Darcy sees Elizabeth, the more he appreciates her intelligence and independence. However, of the belief that a woman’s poor relations “must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world” (36), he finds his increasing admiration of her “mortifying” (24), and the “inferiority of her connections” (51) prevents him from pursuing her. It’s an obstacle frequently brought to his attention by Miss Bingley, who desires him for herself. When Miss Bingley attempts to dampen his attraction for Elizabeth by reminding him of her low connections or independence, Darcy defends Elizabeth; for example, when Miss Bingley mocks Elizabeth for walking three miles to Netherfield, Darcy says he believes her eyes “were brightened by the exercise” (36).His proud, off-putting behavior makes it easy for Elizabeth to believe Wickham’s accusations against him. However, when Elizabeth confronts him about Wickham at the Netherfield ball, Darcy declines to similarly smear Wickham, merely warning her that judging his character at that moment “would reflect no credit on either” (91) of them. In this way Darcy, though not faultless, shows himself to have integrity.His proposal to Elizabeth focuses more on his concern over “the inferiority of your connections” (182) than on his love for her, and after she soundly rejects him, he leaves wounded. Though his letter to her serves primarily to defend himself against her accusations regarding Jane and Wickham—he writes that his “character” forces him to “demand” of her “justice” that she read it (185)—when she meets him at Pemberley she finds his attitude much changed. He is kinder and gentler, and he goes out of his way to make her aunt and uncle feel welcome, even inviting Mr. Gardiner to fish at Pemberley and introducing Elizabeth to his sister. He joins Bingley at Longbourn, sanctioning a relationship he’d previously worked to break up, and he admirably tolerates the frivolous behavior of Elizabeth’s mother. Though he makes these changes for Elizabeth—he demonstrates the depth of his love for her by paying off Wickham’s debts, anonymously—they show that, like Elizabeth, he is not so proud as to be incapable of self-improvement. Having spent “many months” pondering his “unpardonable” (341) behavior, he proves to have taken her criticisms seriously, becoming a fairer, more tolerant man.", "Jane Bennet": "Jane is the eldest Bennet daughter. Described as a great beauty, she is the closest in age and temperament to Elizabeth, though the two differ dramatically in perspective. Whereas Elizabeth questions people’s motives and is more comfortable coming to unpleasant conclusion about their characters, Jane always sees the good in people and is nearly incapable of accepting that they act out of selfishness or malice. When the Bingley party leaves Netherfield, Jane argues that Miss Bingley could never deceive anyone and that she must simply be warning Jane, out of the goodness of her heart, that Bingley doesn’t love her. Rather than accept that Miss Bingley may be duplicitous, Jane blames herself for misinterpreting Bingley’s affection. When Elizabeth tells her about Darcy’s letter, Jane tries “to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other” (210). When Elizabeth complains that people continue to disappoint her, Jane pleads with Elizabeth not to indulge in thoughts that “will ruin your happiness” and to remember that “difference of situation and temper” inspire people to make decisions Elizabeth might not (131). Her optimism extends even to Wickham: before Lydia and Wickham are found, Jane never loses hope that they eventually will marry, and once they do marry, she insists Wickham must have some affection for Lydia. Her good heart and refusal to criticize make her a good match for the buoyantly amiable Bingley and inspire her father, upon her engagement, to pronounce that they are both “so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income” (323).", "Charlotte Lucas": "Elizabeth’s best friend, Charlotte is described as “plain” and is 27 years old, an age when her brothers worry about her “dying an old maid” (117). She often reflects more traditional views, telling Elizabeth, for example, that Darcy’s wealth justifies his pride. Early in the novel, she warns Elizabeth that Jane should show Bingley more affection than she otherwise would, for Jane’s “uniform cheerfulness of manner” (22) may suggest to Bingley that she does not love him. When Elizabeth argues that Jane barely knows Bingley, Charlotte tells her that “[w]hen she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses” (22). Though her point of view is set up to contrast with Elizabeth’s, she is ultimately proved correct when Darcy writes to Elizabeth that he encouraged Bingley to leave Netherfield because he didn’t believe Jane’s affection matched his.Charlotte admits to marrying Mr. Collins because she is “not romantic” (120); she believes marriage to be merely the most practical option, the “pleasantest preservative from want,” for “well-educated young women of small fortune” (117). Her vision of marriage as a mercenary arrangement inspires her to warn Elizabeth not to let her “fancy for Wickham” affect her treatment of Darcy, “a man of ten times his consequence” (88). She believes “[h]appiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance” (23) and that people are better off not knowing their partners’ flaws before marriage. . Charlotte manages her life with Mr. Collins with grace, though, enjoying the comfort of her house and devising routines that put her as little in Mr. Collins’s company as possible; she also quickly learns to bear Lady Catherine’s many suggestions on how she run her household.Charlotte’s acceptance of women’s subversion illustrates the lack of options for women during Austen’s day. Unhopeful that she will be able to achieve both love and financial security in marriage, and seeing marriage as her only refuge from destitution, she does what she feels is most advantageous for a woman in her circumstances. Unlike Elizabeth, she does not fight against the patriarchal system that makes women dependent.", "Mrs. Bennet": "Mrs. Bennet is loud, silly, and full of folly and obsessed with marrying her daughters to rich men. Her relationship with her husband is combative; Mr. Bennet often gives into her whims in order to preserve peace and quiet. When she doesn’t get her way, she complains of her “poor nerves” or that “nobody is on my side” (108). Mrs. Bennet’s unsubtle behavior frequently embarrasses Elizabeth; for example, she scolds Darcy for disparaging the country, inadvertently revealing her provinciality, and at the Netherfield ball, she speaks freely about how Jane’s marriage to Bingley would open the doors for her other daughters to marry rich men. Her scheme to stay late at the Netherfield ball, like her scheme to force Jane to recover from her illness there, is transparent to everyone and is therefore counterproductive to her goal of endearing her family to the Bingleys.Worse, however, is Mrs. Bennet’s indulgence of her youngest daughters’ frivolity, which ultimately leads to Lydia’s elopement with Wickham. Remembering fondly a time when she, too, “liked a red coat myself very well” (30), she encourages her daughters to chase after officers, pleading with Mr. Bennet to bring the family on a trip to Brighton when the officers leave Meryton. When Lydia marries Wickham, rather than feel shame over Lydia’s behavior or gratitude for Mr. Gardiner’s generosity in helping, Mrs. Bennet chastises Mr. Bennet for refusing to send Lydia money for clothes. Oblivious to others’ great efforts to achieve this marriage, Mrs. Bennet sees nothing but the fact that she finally has a daughter married.Mrs. Bennet feels in competition with other women seeking to marry off their daughters and even sends Jane to Netherfield in the rain in the hopes she’ll grow ill and need to stay there. Mrs. Bennet is furious with Mr. Collins, who will inherit Longbourn after Mr. Bennet’s death, but she is thrilled when he decides to marry one of her daughters. When Elizabeth rejects him, Mrs. Bennet calls her “undutiful,” stating she will never speak to her again and that she doesn’t know “who is to maintain you when your father is dead” (108). Mrs. Bennet’s obsession with marriage, though on first glance petty, is not wholly unwarranted. Her frustration with the entail of Longbourn, which makes her daughters dependent on Mr. Collins, is grounded in legitimate concern—a concern reflected in the Lucas sons’ relief that they will not have to look after Charlotte in her old age. With no sons to support them after Mr. Bennet’s death, Mrs. Bennet has reason to wonder what will happen to her unmarried daughters. She therefore is furious at the thought of Charlotte, through Mr. Collins, becoming the mistress of Longbourn, at which time she could choose “to turn herself and her daughters out of the house” (124). It’s perhaps no surprise that, although Elizabeth fears she’ll be devastated by her engagement to Darcy, Mrs. Bennet is delighted, exclaiming about “how rich and how great you will be,” how many “carriages you will have” (351). Her dislike of Darcy, which she’d made abundantly clear, suddenly turns to awe when she learns he will care for one of her daughters.", "Mr. Bennet": "Mr. Bennet was “captivated by youth and beauty” (221) and “had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her” (221).Knowing he will not find intellectual fulfillment or happiness in his marriage, he’s been committed to finding “amusement” in her “ignorance and folly” (221). He finds pleasure in teasing his wife, who usually misses his jokes. Mr. Bennet spends as much time as possible in his library, where he is “always sure of leisure and tranquility” (69). Though frequently frustrated with the silliness of his wife and youngest daughters, he finds comfort with his oldest daughters, especially Elizabeth, whom he sees as having “something more of quickness than her sisters” (7).Mr. Bennet enjoys playing tricks on his wife and daughters, for example deliberately not telling them he’s already visited Bingley and watching their excitement when he reveals this information. He also teases them with quick turns of words, such as when he announces the upcoming visit of Mr. Collins, “who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases” (60). Humor is often his defense against his wife’s frivolity; for example, when Jane, according to Mrs. Bennet’s plan, is too ill to leave Netherfield, he tells his wife that “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders” (32).His tendency to laugh at or ignore his family’s follies, however, brings on folly of its own. He doesn’t stop Kitty and Lydia from visiting the officers, even though he finds this behavior “uncommonly foolish” (31). His lackadaisical attitude is noticed by Darcy, who in his letter to Elizabeth apologetically suggests her father is as guilty of “want of propriety” (187) as her mother. Elizabeth tries to warn him of “the very great disadvantage to us all” that has “already arisen” from “Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner,” only for her father to joke about which lovers Lydia has “frightened away” (216). He allows Lydia to go to Brighton because they “shall have no peace at Longbourn” (217) if he forbids her; he even suggests it would be advantageous if Lydia embarrasses herself at Brighton, for she would be far away from them. His prioritizing quiet over discipline and his failure to see the danger of his wife and daughters’ behavior make Lydia’s elopement with Wickham possible. His gentle-handed manner of discipline is reminiscent of his looseness with finances: he never “laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children,” instead “spending his whole income” (286).Mr. Bennet undergoes a brief period of regret when Lydia runs off with Wickham, telling Elizabeth he deserves to feel the pain he’s caused and refusing to indulge his wife in visiting Bingley upon Bingley’s second arrival at Netherfield. He also wishes he’d had the discipline and foresight to put money aside each year, for if he had, he’d avoid being in debt to Mr. Gardiner, who he believes has paid Wickham’s debts. As the conclusion of the novel draws near, he regains his joking attitude, saying he loves Wickham most of all his sons-in-law. However, there is a note of seriousness in his conversation with Elizabeth regarding her engagement: he objects not to Darcy himself but to the possibility that Elizabeth is marrying him for the wrong reasons, for given her “disposition” and her “lively talents” (349), she would be forever unhappy in an unsatisfying marriage. He begs her: “My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life” (350). His subtle suggestion is that he knows what it’s like to feel no joy with his partner and that he can’t bear the thought of his favorite daughter suffering as he has.", "Mr. Collins": "Mr. Collins benefits from a patriarchal system in which men of means occupy positions of power of they don’t always deserve. In addition, or perhaps as a consequence, he is a believer in the social hierarchy, and sees the upper classes as intrinsically superior.Mr. Collins adheres to the belief that women are mild, delicate, and subservient. For example, he brags of his offering to Miss de Bourgh “those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies” (66) and lectures Lydia that she should read sermons on female behavior. Nowhere is this belief more evident than in his approach to marriage. In looking for a wife, Mr. Collins moves from Jane to Elizabeth to Charlotte without a care, easily allowing each woman to replace the one before as if they are all the same. Just as he assesses the Bennets’ house and furniture “as his own future property” (64), he comes to marriage with hopes of his own happiness. A wife is a possession with which to please Lady Catherine; marriage is a way for him to serve as an “example of matrimony in his parish” (101).His insistence that Elizabeth’s rejections are the result of the “natural delicacy” (101) typical of “elegant females” (104) demonstrates not only how poorly he understands her character, but also the ideal of feminine “modesty” (101). Though Elizabeth begs him to treat her as “a rational creature” (105), he refuses to take her seriously—and tells Mrs. Bennet that if Elizabeth is “liable to such defects of temper” (106)—that is, the inclination to voice her opinions—he would prefer not to marry her after all, for “she could not contribute much to my felicity” (106). By casting Elizabeth as unladylike, he is able to see her rejecting him as her flaw rather than accept it as a reflection on himself. Importantly, his comment to Elizabeth that he could have chosen from “many amiable young women” (102) in his own neighborhood, though arrogant at first glance, in fact proves true when he almost immediately becomes engaged to Charlotte Lucas.Mr. Collins speaks constantly of his patron Lady Catherine de Bourgh, bragging about his closeness to her at every opportunity, clearly missing that her constantly offering her opinion is not a beneficent condescension on her part but in fact a demonstration of arrogant entitlement. He is grateful for any attention from Lady Catherine, interpreting her invitations and even her criticism as evidence of his own importance. It is little wonder Mr. Collins indulges Lady Catherine in her desire “to have the distinction of rank preserved” (154), for the social hierarchy that subverts him to Lady Catherine is the very hierarchy from which he benefits, through his entail of the Longbourn estate."}, "chapter_summaries": {"Volume 1, Chapter 1 Summary": "Mrs. Bennet excitedly informs her husband that Mr. Bingley, a “single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year” (6) has rented Netherfield Park, a nearby estate. According to Mrs. Bennet, this is “a fine thing” (6) for their five daughters. When Mr. Bennet asks why, Mrs. Bennet, exasperated, suggests Bingley may fall in love with one of them. Though she adamantly encourages her husband to visit Bingley, Mr. Bennet is in no hurry, telling her she and the girls may visit Bingley without him; he even suggests the girls go alone, for as Mrs. Bennet is “as handsome as any of them” (6),Bingley may fall in love with her, instead. Mrs. Bennet insists that a woman with “five grown up daughters” does not have the luxury of “thinking of her own beauty” (6).Mrs. Bennet’s desire for her husband to visit Bingley is made greater by the fact that their neighbors, Sir William and Lady Lucas, are going. Mr. Bennet is unmoved, insisting he will “send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls” (6); he adds that he personally prefers their daughter Elizabeth, for Elizabeth “has something more of quickness than her sisters” (7), who “are silly and ignorant like other girls” (7). When Mrs. Bennet accuses her husband of not considering her nerves, Mr. Bennet assures her that he has “a high respect” for her nerves, which are his “old friends” (7).", "Volume 1, Chapter 2 Summary": "Mr. Bennet “had always intended” to visit Bingley and in fact is “among the earliest” of Bingley’s visitors, but he keeps his intention from his wife (8). When Elizabeth is fixing her hat, Mr. Bennet tells her he hopes Bingley will like it; Mrs. Bennet “resentfully” reminds him that they “are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes” because they haven’t met him (8). When Elizabeth suggests their friend, Mrs. Long, can introduce them, Mrs. Bennet tartly complains that Mrs. Long, “a selfish, hypocritical woman” (8), will not introduce them because she is trying to marry off her two nieces. In her frustration, she snaps at her daughter, Kitty, telling her to stop coughing and to “[h]ave a little compassion on my nerves” (8). Mr. Bennet, playing along, states that “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs” (8).Mr. Bennet asks their daughter, Mary, for her opinion; Mary, “a young lady of deep reflection” (9), finds herself unable to come up with a reply. When Mrs. Bennet exclaims that she is “sick of Mr. Bingley,” Mr. Bennet tells her he wishes he had known, for he would not have visited Bingley that morning. The resulting “astonishment […] [is] just that he wished” (9). Mrs. Bennet, overjoyed, states that she knew he loved his daughters too much not to do as she’d asked, and that Kitty is now free to cough as much as she likes.After telling her daughters that “making new acquaintances” is “not so pleasant” but that she does it for their sakes, Mrs. Bennet suggests Bingley will dance with Lydia, the youngest daughter, at the upcoming ball (10). The family then discusses plans to see Bingley in the future.", "Volume 1, Chapter 3 Summary": "Lady Lucas and her husband find Bingley “quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable” (10), and he is willing to attend the next ball. The women are pleased, for “[t]o be fond of dancing [is] a certain step towards falling in love” (10-11). Mrs. Bennet tells Mr. Bennet that she will “have nothing to wish for” if she can arrange for one of her daughters to marry Bingley and for the rest to be “equally well married” (11).A few days later, Bingley visits Mr. Bennet in his library. He is disappointed not to have met the Bennet daughters, “of whose beauty he had heard much” (11), but the daughters manage to catch a glimpse of him from an upstairs window.Bingley is soon joined by his two sisters, brother-in-law, and friend, all of whom attend the ball. Bingley is attractive and friendly, and his sisters are “fine” (11) and fashionable. His friend, Mr. Darcy, is tall, handsome, and noble-looking. Also, according to rumor, his estate earns him £10,000 a year. He’s admired for much of the evening, until he is “discovered to be proud” and “above being pleased,” with “a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance” (12). Whereas Bingley is “lively and unreserved” (12), offering to give a ball at Netherfield, Darcy associates only with the women in his own party. He appears to those in attendance the “most disagreeable man in the world” (12).Elizabeth overhears Darcy telling Bingley that she is “tolerable” but “not handsome enough to tempt me” (13) to dance. Though Elizabeth, who has “a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous,” has “no very cordial feelings towards him,” she laughingly shares the story with her friends (13).Mrs. Bennet is pleased that Bingley dances with Jane twice; Elizabeth, too, is happy for Jane. Kitty and Lydia are happy to have had partners all night. They return to their home, Longbourn, to find Mr. Bennet reading. Mrs. Bennet regales him with tales of Mr. Bingley’s charms and of his obvious admiration of Jane, the only woman whom he asked to dance twice. She pronounces Darcy “high and so conceited,” declaring Elizabeth “does not lose much by not suiting his fancy” (15).", "Volume 1, Chapters 1-3 Analysis": "The famous opening sentence—“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife” (5)—establishes that marriage will be a central theme in the novel. By stating that it is “universally acknowledged,” however, Austen suggests that this “truth” is the opinion of the town, and not necessarily of the man in question. Similarly, the following sentence—which states that “this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families” despite how “little known” (5) the man’s feelings actually are—establishes that gossip, or the meddling of outsiders, will play a role in events to come. The prevalence of gossip—such as the townspeople’s interest in how many people Bingley plans to bring to the Meryton ball—is demonstrated frequently in these chapters.Though the story is told by an omniscient narrator, Austen frequently relays information from the point-of-view of the townspeople. Darcy, who “[is] looked at with great admiration for about half the evening” until “he [is] discovered to be proud, and above his company,” is described according to the people’s opinions of him (12). When he refuses to dance with anyone outside his own party, “[h]is character [is] decided” (12): “He [is] the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world” (12). This hyperbolic statement reinforces that Pride and Prejudice will be, in part, a study of people’s opinions.Characters’ personalities are similarly revealed early on. Mrs. Bennet’s excitement over Bingley’s arrival at Netherfield is the first dialogue of the book; her husband’s passive response to her asking if he’d heard the news—Austen does not give him actual dialogue, instead simply stating that “Mr. Bennet replied that he had not” (5)—suggests that Mr. Bennet plays a more passive role than his exuberant wife.The witty banter for which Pride and Prejudice is known is demonstrated in these early chapters, often in the back-and-forth volleys between the Bennets. Mrs. Bennet often bursts with emotion, and Mr. Bennet responds with a teasing retort that goes over Mrs. Bennet’s head. When Mrs. Bennet complains that Mr. Bennet has “no compassion on my poor nerves,” Mr. Bennet counters that he has “a high respect” for her nerves, which are his “old friends” (7). In Chapter 2, he plays along with his wife’s disappointment that he won’t visit Bingley, even though the visit has already occurred—and the “astonishment” his wife and daughters express “[is] just what he wished” (9). This incident illustrates the playfulness and humor that sustain him in a household of “silly” daughters and a wife “of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper” (7). It also shows the levity with which he treats the social niceties his family takes so seriously.Despite Mr. Bennet’s teasing, Mrs. Bennet’s interest in society is not wholly irrelevant. Her comment that she “shall have nothing to wish for” if she sees her five daughters “well married” (11), while perhaps overly dramatic in the eyes of Mr. Bennet, demonstrates people’s real concern about ensuring the futures of their daughters. Because of the laws of land ownership, the Bennet daughters cannot inherit the family estate, Longbourn, when Mr. Bennet dies. The estate is entailed to a distant cousin, and this leaves the family’s future uncertain. The best chance each daughter has to be financially secure is to marry. Competition for eligible bachelors is established early: Mrs. Bennet’s desire to become friendly with Bingley is made more urgent because the Lucases are intending to do so, and she believes Mrs. Long won’t introduce them because she has nieces of her own. Though she is gossipy and frivolous, Mrs. Bennet’s urgency is inspired by real concern, a concern that Mr. Bennet appears not to acknowledge.", "Volume 1, Chapter 4 Summary": "Jane had been hesitant to speak too highly of Bingley, but when she’s alone with Elizabeth, she confesses that she finds him “sensible,” “good-humored,” and in possession of “perfect good breeding” (15). She was surprised by his invitation to dance with him twice; Elizabeth is not surprised, replying that Bingley “could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room” (15). Elizabeth notes that Jane “never see[s] a fault in any body“(16) and has never uttered a negative word about anyone. When Jane replies that she only speaks her thoughts, Elizabeth agrees, wondering how someone with such “good sense” can be “so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others” (16).Jane says that Bingley’s sisters are “very pleasing women when you converse with them” (16); Elizabeth silently disagrees, having found them “proud and conceited” (16). Though handsome and well-educated, with “a fortune of twenty thousand pounds” (16),Bingley’s sisters seem to place more importance on the fact that they are “of a respectable family in the north of England” (16) than on the fact that “their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade” (16-17).Bingley’s father had intended to purchase an estate but died before he had the chance; he’d left £100,000 to Bingley. Bingley also had intended to purchase an estate; however, he’d rented Netherfield after a half-hour’s inspection, and his sisters, though “by no means unwilling to preside at his table,” fear the “easiness of his temper” might lead him to “leave the next generation to purchase” (17).Bingley and Darcy are good friends despite their “great opposition of character” (17). Bingley is universally-liked, whereas Darcy, the more “clever” of the two, is seen as “haughty” and “reserved” (17). Also, Bingley has “the firmest reliance” on Darcy’s judgment (17). Bingley speaks highly of the Meryton dance, claiming he’s never seen more beautiful women and that everyone had been “most kind and attentive to him” (18). Darcy finds the people without “beauty” or “fashion” (18). Bingley’s sisters, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, agree with Darcy that Jane “smiled too much” (18) but approve of her nonetheless.", "Volume 1, Chapter 5 Summary": "The Bennet family is friendly with the Lucas family, at the head of which is Sir William Lucas, whose meeting with the king in his capacity as mayor had led to his knighthood and inspired him to quit the trade that had made him “a tolerable fortune” (18). Lady Lucas is “not too clever to be a valuable neighbor to Mrs. Bennet” (19), and Elizabeth and the eldest Lucas daughter Charlotte are good friends.The Lucases visit the Bennets to discuss the Meryton ball. Mrs. Bennet politely compliments Charlotte on being Bingley’s first choice in dancing partners; when Charlotte notes that Bingley preferred Jane, Mrs. Bennet feigns surprise.At Charlotte’s mention of Darcy’s rudeness toward Elizabeth, Mrs. Bennet says Mrs. Long had attempted a conversation with him and that “he seemed very angry at being spoke to” (20). Jane explains that Miss Bingley told her he is “remarkably agreeable” (20) among those he knows well. Mrs. Bennet does not believe her, telling Elizabeth she should never dance with him. Charlotte suggests his pride is made less offensive because it’s justified by his fortune and good breeding, to which Elizabeth responds that she “could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine” (20).Elizabeth’s sister, Mary, states that pride is “a very common failing” (20) and that “there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary” (21).", "Volume 1, Chapter 6 Summary": "The Bingley party visits the Bennets at Longbourn, and Jane and Bingley’s attraction becomes even clearer to Elizabeth. Charlotte worries that Jane, who shows “a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner” (22), is not showing enough affection toward Bingley; that lovers need encouragement, and Jane’s naturally-pleasant nature may not allow Bingley to see her affection for him. Jane, Charlotte says, should “make the most of every half hour” of her time with Bingley until “she is secure of him” (22). When Elizabeth comments that Jane has known Bingley for only two weeks, Charlotte states that “[h]appiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance” and that it’s better for people “to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life” (23).In the meantime, Darcy takes a begrudging interest in Elizabeth. The more he sees her, the more he’s “forced to acknowledge” that her face is “rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes” (24).Though these discoveries are “mortifying” (24), he pays close attention to her conversations with others, a habit that makes her suspect he seeks to criticize her. When he approaches her after one such conversation, she teasingly asks him if she spoke eloquently. They engage in brief, sharp banter until Charlotte requests that Elizabeth entertain them on the piano.Sir William Lucas approaches Darcy and attempts, unsuccessfully, to engage him in conversation, noting that dancing is “one of the first refinements of polished societies,” to which Darcy responds that “every savage can dance” (26). In an attempt to encourage Darcy to dance, Sir William calls to Elizabeth, asking Darcy “who could object to such a partner” (27). Though Darcy is “not unwilling” (27) to dance with Elizabeth, Elizabeth refuses.Miss Bingley complains to Darcy about the “insipidity” and “self-importance of all these people” and is surprised when he informs her he’d been thinking about the “very great pleasure” he’s finding in watching Elizabeth, who has “a pretty face” and “a pair of very fine eyes” (27). Jokingly asking about their wedding, Miss Bingley speaks of the “charming mother-in-law” he’ll acquire, continuing to tease him while he listens “with perfect indifference” (28).", "Volume 1, Chapters 4-6 Analysis": "Many characters in Pride and Prejudice have contrasts or counterparts. Jane’s tendency “to like people in general” and to “never see a fault in any body” contrasts with Elizabeth’s “quickness of observation” and more critical eye (16). Bingley, with his “pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners,” is “lively and unreserved” and dances with many partners, whereas Darcy, “forbidding” and “disagreeable,” dances only with members of his own party (12). After the Meryton ball, Bingley feels he “[has] never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life,” but Darcy “[has] seen a collection of people in whom there [is] little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he [has] felt the smallest interest” (18). Bingley’s and Jane’s sunny dispositions make them clearly well-matched. Similarly, Darcy and Elizabeth are established as sharp and cerebral, and Darcy is already attracted to the “uncommonly intelligent” look in the “beautiful expression of her dark eyes” (24).Elizabeth is also contrasted with her friend Charlotte Lucas, who in response to Elizabeth’s insistence that, after only two weeks, Jane shouldn’t expect to “be certain of the degree of her own regard” (23) for Bingley, states that couples shouldn’t know too well of each other’s “defects” (23) before marriage. With her warning that if Jane wants to marry Bingley, she should “show more affection than she feels” (22) and enjoy the luxury of falling in love with him later, Charlotte represents a practical, more sober view of marriage than Elizabeth, who places value on affection. Like Mrs. Bennet, Charlotte recognizes the importance of marrying well and the challenges young women face in establishing their futures. She reflects traditional society’s views and sees situations with a pragmatic, rather than romantic, eye, which is why Darcy’s pride “does not offend” her, for as a “fine young man with family, fortune, every thing in his favour [sic],” he has “an excuse” to be proud (20). As opposed to Elizabeth, Charlotte’s object in marriage is position and security, and though her approach may appear cold and mercenary, she arguably is better equipped to navigate the 19th-century patriarchy than Elizabeth.Contrasts in Pride and Prejudice are not limited to the dispositions of the characters. The book is rife with misunderstandings, contrasts between the truth and people’s beliefs. In Chapter 6, Elizabeth, whose pride was “mortified” (21) by Darcy’s insult, misunderstands Darcy’s interest in her conversations; though in truth he’s attempting to “know more of her,” she assumes he wishes to judge her with his “satirical eye” (24). Pride, the overabundance of it or the wounding of it, is often the catalyst for these misunderstandings, and will continue to be throughout Pride and Prejudice.Contrast also exists between people’s visions of their status and what their status actually is. Sir William Lucas exploits his lowly title to attempt camaraderie with Darcy, bragging of his connections with “superior society” (26) without recognizing the condescension in Darcy’s responses. Mrs. Bennet, who ogles over the Bingley sisters and tells her husband they are “charming women” (14), fails to see their disdain of her. Even the superior Bingley sisters inflate their status, seeming to forget “that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade” (16-17), rather than through inheritance. In a society that values title and prestige, people install themselves above others in an attempt to appear more distinguished.", "Volume 1, Chapter 7 Summary": "Mr. Bennet’s estate—its farms and properties—earns £2,000 a year. As he has no sons, it’s entailed to a distant male relation. Mrs. Bennet’s own inheritance is not enough to support her daughters. It is implied that because this male relation will inherit the estate, the security of the Bennet daughters rests in his hands.The Bennet girls enjoy walking into the town of Meryton, where their aunt, Mrs. Philips, who is Mrs. Bennet’s sister, resides. Kitty and Lydia, the two youngest, especially like to pass their unoccupied time there, visiting a hat shop and listening to gossip. When a militia regiment makes Meryton its headquarters, Kitty and Lydia are overjoyed. Every day brings officer-related gossip. Mr. Bennet says they are “two of the silliest girls in the country” (29), earning the ire of Mrs. Bennet, who assures him that their behavior is age-appropriate and that “if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him” (30).One morning a message arrives for Jane: Bingley’s sisters have invited her for dinner while the men visit Meryton. Jane asks for use of the carriage. Mrs. Bennet insists that Jane go on horseback, for “it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night” (31). When torrential rains come shortly after Jane leaves, her sisters worry, but Mrs. Bennet is delighted.The next morning, a message from Jane arrives for Elizabeth: she isn’t feeling well, and Bingley’s sisters won’t hear of her leaving until she’s better. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that if Jane dies, “it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley” (32). Elizabeth, concerned, walks to Netherfield to see Jane.She arrives covered in mud. She’s received with surprise by Bingley’s sisters and warmly by Bingley himself. Darcy is simultaneously attracted by the “brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion” (33) and doubtful that she should have come alone.Jane is too feverish to leave her room and is grateful for Elizabeth’s visit. Elizabeth appreciates the kindness with which Bingley’s sisters tend to Jane. Finally, she reluctantly says she must go, and Bingley’s sisters offer her their carriage. Seeing Jane’s distress on her sister’s leaving, they invite Elizabeth to stay at Netherfield.", "Volume 1, Chapter 8 Summary": "At dinner, Elizabeth realizes how little Bingley’s sisters care about Jane’s welfare, and her newfound warmth disappears. Bingley is genuinely concerned for Jane, and he makes Elizabeth feel welcome.After Elizabeth returns to Jane, Bingley’s sisters insult her, saying she has “no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty,” and mock her “wild” appearance that morning (35). They can’t understand why she would walk so far just because her sister has a cold. Miss Bingley adds that it shows “an abominable sort of conceited independence” (36); Bingley counters that she “looked remarkably well” (35) and that “[i]t shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing” (36).When Miss Bingley asks Darcy if Elizabeth’s “adventure” detracts from his “admiration of her fine eyes,” he says they “were brightened by the exercise” (36). Mrs. Hurst says Jane “is really a very sweet girl” but that, considering her “low connections,” a match could never take place (36). She and Miss Bingley laugh over the fact that Jane and Elizabeth’s uncles make their livings in trade. Bingley states their relations don’t matter; Darcy responds that their connections “lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world” (36). Bingley’s sisters continue laughing “at the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations,” then visit her in her room “[w]ith a renewal of tenderness” (36).After Jane falls asleep, Elizabeth reads in the drawing room. Miss Bingley says Elizabeth “is a great reader, and has no pleasure in any thing else,” appalling Elizabeth, who says she “deserve[s] neither such praise nor such censure” (37).Bingley, Miss Bingley, and Darcy discuss the merits of Darcy’s estate Pemberley; Darcy derides those who neglect their family libraries. Miss Bingley inquires after Darcy’s sister, commenting on how accomplished she is. Bingley expresses admiration for how accomplished young women are; Darcy proclaims he knows few women who are truly accomplished. Miss Bingley offers a list of skills a woman must possess to be considered accomplished. Darcy says a woman must possess all these skills and also “must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading” (39). When Elizabeth expresses doubt that any woman could meet all these requirements, Miss Bingley exclaims they know many such women.Later, Elizabeth informs them that Jane’s condition is worse, and they decide to send for the doctor in the morning. Bingley is genuinely distraught. His sisters express their misery, then entertain themselves by singing duets.", "Volume 1, Chapter 9 Summary": "The next morning, Elizabeth sends a note to Longbourn requesting that her mother come to Netherfield to assess Jane’s health. Mrs. Bennet arrives with Kitty and Lydia. On finding Jane’s condition not serious, she declares Jane too ill to leave Netherfield. Bingley is shocked that they’d consider removing her; Miss Bingley coldly assures Mrs. Bennet Jane will receive good care. Mrs. Bennet expresses gratitude, telling them Jane’s sweet disposition gives her patience to suffer through her illness and that she often tells her other daughters “they are nothing to her” (41).Mrs. Bennet tells Bingley she hopes he will stay at Netherfield for a while. Bingley responds that he plans to stay but that as he does everything in a hurry, if he were to leave, he “should probably be off in five minutes” (42). After Elizabeth says she isn’t surprised, Bingley comments that she is “a studier of character” (42). Darcy interjects that the country has less varied society and fewer opportunities to study character, and Mrs. Bennet, offended, emphatically disagrees, saying London has “no great advantage over the country” (43). Bingley states that both the city and the country have advantages. Mrs. Bennet comments that he has the right disposition, as opposed to Darcy, who “seem[s] to think the country [is] nothing at all” (43). Embarrassed, Elizabeth assures her mother that Darcy meant only that there are more people in the city. Mrs. Bennet asserts she dines with many people in her neighborhood. Miss Bingley casts Darcy “a very expressive smile” (43).In an attempt to change the subject, Elizabeth asks her mother about Charlotte Lucas. Mrs. Bennet raves about Sir William’s manners, saying he is “so genteel and so easy,” which is her “idea of good-breeding,” as opposed to those “who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths” (43). She adds that while Charlotte is considered plain, Jane is considered beautiful by everyone. Elizabeth and Darcy exchange a short, witty volley about poetry, eliciting a smile from Darcy.Lydia, “a favorite with her mother” (45) for her “fine complexion and good humored countenance (44-45), reminds Bingley that he’d promised to give a ball. Bingley agrees to keep his promise as soon as Jane is well. When the Bennets leave and Elizabeth returns to Jane, Bingley’s sisters mock them again. Darcy does not join in, even when Miss Bingley teases him about Elizabeth’s fine eyes.", "Volume 1, Chapter 10 Summary": "That night in the drawing room, Miss Bingley fawns over Darcy as he writes to his sister, complimenting him on “his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter” (46). She doesn’t notice his indifference.Bingley’s comment that his own letters contain errors because his “ideas flow so rapidly” (47) prompts a boisterous conversation in which Darcy claims Bingley is complimenting himself in a roundabout way, just as he was earlier when he claimed he’d leave Netherfield in five minutes. He states that as quickly as Bingley would leave Netherfield, he’d stay if a friend asked him to. Elizabeth says Darcy has proven Bingley’s point; she also asks if “the rashness” of Bingley’s hypothetical decision to leave would be “atoned for” by his “obstinacy in adhering to it” (48). Darcy replies that the hypothetical friend has offered no argument to prove the worth of his request and suggests they determine the degree of intimacy between the two friends. Bingley declares that “if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow,” he “should not pay him half so much deference” (49). Though Darcy smiles, Elizabeth perceives he’s offended and refrains from laughing.Darcy finishes his letter and asks that Elizabeth and Miss Bingley play the piano. Darcy watches Elizabeth play, and she assumes he’s finding ways to criticize her. When Miss Bingley plays, Darcy asks Elizabeth if she’d like to dance. She replies that he’s only asking so he “might have the pleasure of despising my taste” and that she “always delight[s] in overthrowing those kinds of schemes” (50). When she says he can despise her if he dares, he surprises her by replying, “Indeed I do not dare” (50). Darcy, noting the “mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner” (50), has “never been so bewitched by any woman” (51). Had it not been for “the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger” (51).Miss Bingley notices and is jealous. The next day, in the garden, she teases Darcy about Elizabeth. Her suggestions to teach his mother-in-law to keep quiet and to discourage the girls from chasing officers meet with sarcasm, which goes over her head. When Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth approach, Mrs. Hurst joins them, leaving Elizabeth to herself; when Darcy suggests walking a path that can fit all of them, Elizabeth declines, running “gaily off” (52).", "Volume 1, Chapters 7-10 Analysis": "Mrs. Bennet has been cast as self-involved and tactless; however, her comment to Bingley that “good-breeding” entails being “genteel” and “easy” (43) proves true in these chapters.Though the Bingley sisters see themselves as superior, their behavior shows them to be superficial and malicious. They mock Elizabeth for making the “nonsensical” journey to visit her sister and laugh about the condition of her clothing. Bingley responds that her behavior indicates a “pleasing” (36) love for her sister—something his own sisters can’t understand. Their deriding Elizabeth for making sacrifices to care for Jane suggests this is not something they would do for each other.Their kindness in tending to Jane is tempered by their entertaining themselves “at the expense of their dear friend’s relations” (36). Austen’s language in describing how they “solaced their wretchedness” (40) over Jane’s condition with “duets after supper” (40) is deftly ironic; Jane is clearly not their “dear friend,” and their singing after supper shows they aren’t wretched at all. Similarly, “Bingley was quite uncomfortable” (40), whereas “his sisters declared that they were miserable” (40, emphasis added). This subtle difference in language shows Bingley’s sisters say one thing and feel another. This is reinforced when, walking in the garden with Darcy, Miss Bingley mocks Elizabeth behind her back, only to fear she was “overheard” (51) as Elizabeth approaches.Elizabeth, of course, is not interested in impressing the Bingley sisters. When Mrs. Bennet tells her she “will not be fit to be seen” after walking to Netherfield, Elizabeth responds, “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want” (32). When Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley exclude her from their walk, she “gaily” (52) declines Darcy’s invitation join them. Her indifference to the opinions of others earns her an accusation of “conceited independence” (36) from Miss Bingley.It’s precisely this independence that attracts Darcy to Elizabeth. It’s no coincidence that when Miss Bingley chides Elizabeth for taking “no pleasure” (37) in anything but books, Darcy, who “cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library” (38), states that a woman is only “accomplished” if she pursues “the improvement of her mind by extensive reading” (39).Whereas his exchanges with Miss Bingley are topical and lacking in substance, with Elizabeth he has philosophical conversations in which she challenges him to think more deeply. Miss Bingley fawns over Darcy’s letter writing and offers empty compliments, to the point where Austen describes her as Darcy’s “faithful assistant” (39). In contrast, the discussion of Bingley’s hypothetical friend pushes Darcy and Elizabeth to defend their points with thoughtfulness and passion, stimulating Darcy’s mind and resulting in his feeling “bewitched” (51).In this context, Darcy’s standoffish behavior appears the result not only of pride but also weariness. When Miss Bingley tells Darcy that Elizabeth is employing “a very mean art” (40) to “recommend” herself to him, Darcy retorts that “all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation” are “despicable” (40), clearly seeing through her own arts. Earlier chapters have already established that wealthy men are often chased and ogled. To Darcy, Elizabeth’s appeal is her “archness” (50) and refusal to flatter. As a result, Miss Bingley’s attempts to “provoke Darcy into disliking” (51) Elizabeth only put him off further.Elizabeth, however, misinterprets Darcy’s affection. When he watches her, she assumes he finds something “wrong” with her; when he asks her to dance a reel, she tells him he wants only “the pleasure of despising my taste” (50). Elizabeth’s prejudice against Darcy will result in many misunderstandings and will affect the course of their lives.", "Volume 1, Chapter 11 Summary": "That night, in the drawing room, Darcy attempts to read but is interrupted frequently by Miss Bingley, who tries in vain to draw him into conversation. She walks around the room to gain Darcy’s attention; when that fails, she invites Elizabeth to join her. Darcy finally looks up. He declines an invitation to join them and says he can imagine two reasons they are walking. Miss Bingley asks him to explain what he means. Darcy says they either have secrets to discuss or wish to show off their figures. If they have secrets, he’ll leave them alone. If they wish to show off their figures, he can watch them more easily from where he sits.Miss Bingley expresses shock and asks how they can punish him. Elizabeth replies that they can punish him by laughing at him. Miss Bingley says it’s impossible to laugh at a man of such “calmness of temper and presence of mind” and that they’ll look foolish if they “laugh without a subject” (55). Elizabeth replies that a person who can’t be laughed at has “an uncommon advantage” (55) and an unfortunate one, for she loves to laugh.Darcy says even the best of men can be laughed at by someone “whose first object in life is a joke” (55). Elizabeth says she never laughs at “what is wise and good” (55). She laughs only at “[f]ollies and nonsense” (55) and supposes he has none. Darcy says he strives “to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule” (56).Elizabeth playfully states that Darcy has no flaw. Darcy denies this, offering that his greatest flaw is that his “good opinion once lost is lost for ever” (56). Elizabeth agrees that this is a flaw but admits she can’t laugh at it. Darcy suggests every person has “a natural defect,” to which Elizabeth responds that his defect is “a propensity to hate every body” (56). Darcy smiles and tells her that her defect “is willfully [sic] to misunderstand them” (56). Miss Bingley, feeling left out, suggests they play some music.", "Volume 1, Chapter 12 Summary": "Despite Elizabeth’s pleading, Mrs. Bennet refuses to send the carriage, desiring for Elizabeth and Jane to remain at Netherfield a few days longer. Elizabeth, fearful of staying too long, asks Jane to request the use of Mr. Bingley’s carriage. The Netherfield party urges them to stay at least until the following day, and Elizabeth and Jane agree. Miss Bingley regrets this, for “her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other” (58). Bingley begs them to stay even longer, but Jane feels it’s time for them to go.Darcy is happy that Elizabeth is leaving, for “[s]he attract[s] him more than he like[s]” (58). He speaks to her as little as possible this final day, lest he reveal his attraction. Even when they are left alone together for a half-hour, he doesn’t speak to or look at her.Miss Bingley is suddenly warm upon their leaving. Mrs. Bennet, however, is disappointed at their return. Mr. Bennet is happy to see them, for family conversation “had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth” (59). Upon Jane and Elizabeth’s return, Kitty and Lydia subject them to frivolous gossip about officers.", "Volume 1, Chapter 13 Summary": "Mr. Bennet announces that a man is coming to join them for dinner and enjoys the eager questioning of his wife and daughters. He eventually tells them that the guest is Mr. Collins, the cousin to whom the Bennet estate is entailed. Mrs. Bennet laments the unfairness of the system that entails his property away from his daughters.In a letter, Mr. Collins explains that a disagreement between his late father and Mr. Bennet has troubled him and that since losing his father, he’s desired to “heal the breach” (61). Since being ordained, he’s benefited from the patronage of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and his rectory is located in her parish. Now that he’s a clergyman, it is his “duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence” (61). He apologizes for being in the position of “injuring” Mr. Bennet’s “amiable daughters” and states his “readiness to make them every possible amends” (61). He closes by suggesting he “trespass on your hospitality” (61) the following week, adding that Lady Catherine will not object as long as another clergyman can take his place on Sunday.Elizabeth, who is “chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine,” finds “something very pompous in his style” (63). When she asks if he can be “a sensible man,” Mr. Bennet replies that he has “great hopes of finding him quite the reverse” (63).Mr. Collins arrives and needs no encouragement to talk. He is complimentary of the Bennet girls’ beauty, stating he doesn’t doubt that they will marry well. Mrs. Bennet hopes so, “for else they will be destitute enough” (63). She states he “must confess” that it is “a grievous affair” (63) for her daughters, though she doesn’t find fault with him personally. Mr. Collins assures her that he is “sensible […] of the hardship,” that he has “come prepared to admire them,” and that he will say more on the subject later (63).At dinner, Mr. Collins admires the house and furniture; Mrs. Bennet would be pleased “but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it as his own future property” (64).", "Volume 1, Chapter 14 Summary": "Mr. Bennet brings up the subject of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, correctly assessing that Mr. Collins is eager to discuss her. Mr. Collins praises Lady Catherine, claiming he “ha[s] never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank” (64) and that she has been extraordinarily gracious to him by asking him to dine at Rosings and visiting him “in his humble parsonage” (65), even bestowing on him some advice on how to furnish it.When Mrs. Bennet asks about Lady Catherine’s daughter, Mr. Collins replies that according to Lady Catherine, Miss de Bourgh is even more beautiful than other women “because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth” (65). However, as she has “a sickly constitution” (65), she doesn’t possess many accomplishments. Her kindness is demonstrated in the fact that she “often condescends to drive by my humble abode” (66) in her carriage. Mr. Collins describes how he pays Miss de Bourgh little compliments whenever possible, for compliments “are always acceptable to ladies” (66). These many compliments are well regarded by Lady Catherine, and Mr. Collins feels “peculiarly bound to pay” (66). Mr. Bennet is delighted, for Mr. Collins is “as absurd as he had hoped” (66).After dinner, the family takes to reading. Mr. Collins declares he never reads novels, and after being offered a wide selection of books, he chooses a book of sermons for young women. As he is reading, Lydia chatters to Mrs. Bennet about the officers. Mr. Collins laments that young women so seldom read serious books, even though they are “written solely for their benefit” (67). Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologize for Lydia, and Mr. Collins says he “bore his young cousin no ill-will” (67). Then he and Mr. Bennet begin a game of backgammon.", "Volume 1, Chapter 15 Summary": "Austen writes that “Mr. Collins [is] not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society” (68). Though meeting his requirements at his university, he failed to make connections necessary to advance his career. He obtained the patronage of Lady Catherine due to a “fortunate chance.” His exaggerated deference to Lady Catherine, combined with his “very good opinion of himself,” results in his being “a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility” (68). His “excessively generous” (68) plan to atone for his being entailed the Bennet estate is to marry one of the Bennet daughters, as long as they are as beautiful as he has heard.He poses his plan to Mrs. Bennet. He originally had chosen Jane to take as his wife, but when Mrs. Bennet informs him that Jane will probably soon be engaged, he easily switches to Elizabeth. Mrs. Bennet is delighted that soon, two of her daughters will be married.Lydia and her sisters, save for Mary, decide to walk into Meryton. Mr. Bennet, eager to get rid of Mr. Collins, who ceaselessly talks to him while he’s in his library, suggests he join them. Mr. Collins is happy to put away his book and agrees.On arriving in Meryton, Kitty and Lydia are distracted by the officers, including their friend, Mr. Denny, and his friend, a handsome, charming stranger. Mr. Denny informs the girls that his friend is Mr. Wickham and that he has just “accepted a commission in their corps” (70). The Bennet daughters pass some time talking with him, pleased by his “happy readiness of conversation” (70), until Bingley and Darcy draw close on their horses. Darcy and Wickham exchange a tense, unpleasant look before Wickham touches his hat and leaves, “a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deign[s] to return” (71). Elizabeth can’t help but wonder what it means.They arrive at the house of their aunt, Mrs. Philips. Mr. Collins is profuse in his apologies for his intrusion; Mrs. Philips is impressed with his good breeding. She tells the girls that some officers are dining at their house the next night and that she’ll invite Wickham.They return home. Mr. Collins pleases Mrs. Bennet by telling her that Mrs. Philips is the most “elegant” (72) woman he’s seen in his life, other than Lady Catherine.", "Volume 1, Chapters 11-15 Analysis": "Mr. Collins’s entrance triggers a series of events that determine the course of characters’ lives. He also serves as a useful vehicle through which readers are offered deeper glimpses into characters’ psyches. Mr. Collins’s personality and his interactions provide a better understanding of central characters.Comparing Darcy to Mr. Collins reveals Darcy’s sincerity and depth of character. At Netherfield, Elizabeth teases that Darcy lacks “[f]ollies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies” (55)—that he is without “defect” (55). Darcy contradicts her, insisting he has never claimed to be without defect. He is honest in his self-assessment, stating that his flaw is one of “temper”—he “cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself” (56). When Elizabeth suggests his “defect is a propensity to hate every body” (56), he smiles—and gently informs her that her defect “is willfully [sic] to misunderstand” (56) people. In this passage, Darcy not only speaks with humility and self-awareness, but avoids excessive flattery of Elizabeth. He chooses his words carefully and speaks sparingly, and only when he has something important to say.On the contrary, Mr. Collins’s unctuousness is evident from his first letter to the Bennets, in which he demonstrates overblown self-importance with his verbose descriptions of his position and circumstances. Elizabeth wonders at his excessive “deference” (62) to Lady Catherine, whom Mr. Collins later will praise profusely for deigning to visit him at his “humble parsonage” and for the beauty of her daughter, who is blessed with features of a “young woman of distinguished birth” (65). So engrossed is he in his reverence to his social superior that he fails to recognize Mr. Bennet’s mocking questions, explaining with all seriousness how he relays to Miss de Bourgh the “little elegant compliments” (66) that so please women. His puffed-up effusiveness, as well as his exaggerated praise of the Bennet daughters, of Mrs. Philips, and even of Mrs. Bennet’s furniture—which she suspects he appraises as a future owner—reveal him to be insincere.The ease with which Mr. Collins moves from Jane to Elizabeth—when Mrs. Bennet tells him Jane will likely soon be engaged, Mr. Collins “[has] only to change” (69) from one sister to the other—further distinguishes him from Darcy, who finds himself attracted to Elizabeth for specific qualities that complement his own. While Darcy recognizes and appreciates Elizabeth’s intellect and honesty, Mr. Collins sees her as another body in line to receive his beneficence.Interestingly, Elizabeth comments that while Darcy’s “[i]mplacable resentment” is “a failing, indeed” (56), it is a fault that she “cannot laugh at” (56)—as opposed to Mr. Collins’s “absurd” diatribes, which Mr. Bennet, who’d had “great hopes” of Mr. Collins being “an oddity” (62), observes “with the keenest enjoyment” (66). Elizabeth’s assertion that she hopes Darcy’s inability to be laughed at remains “an uncommon advantage” because she “dearly love[s] a laugh” and reiterates her likeness to her father, who shares her quick wit and skeptical nature (55).Finally, Mr. Collins’s entrance reminds readers that Mrs. Bennet is justified in her fears for her daughters’ futures. Though joking, Mr. Bennet speaks accurately when he declares that after his death, Mr. Collins “may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases” (60). Mr. Bennet frequently demonstrates exasperation for the marriage-obsessed antics of his wife; however, subsequent chapters show the dangerous effects of his lackadaisical approach.", "Volume 1, Chapter 16 Summary": "At dinner, Mr. Collins flatters Mrs. Philips by stating her house reminds him of a small room at Rosings; once she learns what Rosings is, Mrs. Philips eagerly receives the compliment.When Wickham walks in, Elizabeth is reminded how attractive he is. Though he is the object of every woman’s stare, he sits next to Elizabeth. She is curious about how he knows Darcy and is surprised when he says their families have been connected for years. Wickham alludes to their tense meeting the previous day and asks if she knows him well. She responds she knows him “[a]s well as I ever wish to” (75); Wickham says he can’t offer an opinion but that most people are “blinded by his fortune […] or frightened by his high and imposing manners” (76). Elizabeth assures him that everybody in Hertfordshire is “disgusted with his pride” (76). She hopes his plans are not altered by Darcy’s being close by.Wickham says he has no reason to avoid Darcy other than “a sense of very great ill usage” (76). Darcy’s father bequeathed him a career with the church, but Darcy prevented him from obtaining it, leaving him destitute. Elizabeth, shocked, says Darcy “deserves to be publicly disgraced” (78). When Wickham says he will not disgrace him out of deference to Darcy’s father, “Elizabeth honor[s] him for such feelings, and [thinks] him handsomer than ever as he expresse[s] them” (78). Wickham adds that Darcy is jealous of him for his father’s love, explaining that they’d grown up together and that his own father took care of Pemberley when Darcy’s father grew older.Wickham admits that Darcy is “a very kind and careful guardian of his sister” (79), who is also overly proud. Elizabeth wonders how Darcy can be so friendly with “sweet-tempered” Bingley. Wickham responds that Darcy “can please where he chooses” (80).Mr. Collins loses money at cards and proclaims that “happily” Lady Catherine’s patronage means he is “not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object” (80). Wickham informs Elizabeth that Lady Catherine was the sister of Darcy’s mother and that Darcy and his cousin, Miss de Bourgh, are expected to marry. Elizabeth says Lady Catherine sounds “arrogant” and “conceited” (81), and Wickham agrees.On the way home, Elizabeth can’t stop thinking of Wickham but doesn’t have a chance to mention him, as Lydia and Mr. Collins monopolize the conversation.", "Volume 1, Chapter 17 Summary": "Elizabeth tells Jane what she’s learned from Wickham. Jane can’t believe Bingley could be so deceived or that Wickham could have suffered so much, stating that Darcy and Wickham must both have “been deceived” about each other. Elizabeth jokes that Jane is trying to avoid thinking poorly of anyone. Jane insists that Darcy couldn’t possibly have behaved so badly, that Bingley couldn’t be so wrong about him. Elizabeth says Bingley is more likely to be deceived than Wickham is to lie—“there was truth in his looks” (83).Bingley and his sisters arrive to give Jane her invitation to the Netherfield ball. His sisters speak warmly to her and avoid the rest of the family as much as possible before fleeing, to Bingley’s chagrin.Elizabeth is excited to dance with Wickham and to find “a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour” (84). She asks Mr. Collins if he intends to go to the ball and is surprised to hear that he not only is going but also intends to dance. She is horrified when he asks her to dance the first two dances with him, for she’d intended those dances for Wickham; she reluctantly accepts, realizing “that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage” (85). The increased attention Mr. Collins pays her and her mother’s sly comments confirm her suspicion.", "Volume 1, Chapter 18 Summary": "Elizabeth is disappointed when Wickham is not at the Netherfield ball. Believing Darcy responsible, she struggles to be civil with him. He surprises her by asking her to dance. Charlotte suggests she may enjoy it; Elizabeth declares that finding “a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate” would be “the greatest misfortune” (88). Charlotte warns her not to let her feelings for Wickham “make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence” (88).While dancing, Elizabeth alludes to her new friendship with Wickham; Darcy says Wickham “is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends” (89) but that he struggles to keep them. When Elizabeth notes that he’s lost Darcy’s friendship, Darcy does not respond. Elizabeth reminds him that he’d told her his “resentment once created was unappeasable” and asks if he is careful not to be “blinded by prejudice” (90), for those whose opinions never change must form correct opinions. She also says she receives “different accounts” of his character. He hopes she won’t judge him “at the present moment” (91) because it would not reflect well on either of them. When the dance is over, they are both upset, though Darcy’s “powerful feeling” (91) toward Elizabeth makes him forgive her. Jane tells Elizabeth that Bingley has confirmed that Wickham is not respectable and that Darcy has been kinder than Wickham deserves. Elizabeth responds that Bingley doesn’t know the whole story.Elizabeth is horrified as Mr. Collins fawns over Darcy, who addresses him with “distant civility” (94) and moves away. She is further mortified when her mother gushes to Lady Lucas about how wonderful it will be when Jane marries Bingley. Noticing Darcy can hear every word, Elizabeth encourages her mother to talk quietly, to no avail. Elizabeth’s sister Mary, a poor singer, performs for the party and refuses to step down. Mr. Collins offers a long speech about the duties of a clergyman and his own opinion of music, amusing Mr. Bennet.When Mr. Collins monopolizes Elizabeth, Charlotte distracts him. The Bennets, by a maneuvering of Mrs. Bennet, are the last to leave, and Bingley’s sisters do not hide their disdain. Mrs. Bennet is pleased that Jane will be living at Netherfield soon. She’s also happy that Elizabeth, the daughter “least dear” (99) to her, will soon marry Mr. Collins.", "Volume 1, Chapters 16-18 Analysis": "First Impressions, the original title of Pride and Prejudice, is an apt descriptor of these chapters. Elizabeth demonstrates level-headedness, perception, and good judgment, and her father describes her as the most sensible of all his daughters. Her association with Mr. Wickham, however, illustrates how she is a victim of her own prejudices.Wickham’s comment to Elizabeth that “Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses” (80) is an appropriate description of Wickham himself. With his good looks and charm, he immediately attracts Elizabeth, who is all too ready to accept his accusations against Darcy. Sitting next to Elizabeth at dinner—a choice that appears deliberate, for he’s aware that she noticed the “cold manner of” (75) his meeting with Darcy the day before—he wastes no time probing for Elizabeth’s opinion of Darcy. When he confirms her opinion, Elizabeth listens eagerly, complimenting him for his grace in handling the injustice he claims to have suffered at Darcy’s hand, thinking “him handsomer than ever” (78). Not at all dubious of Wickham revealing this personal story to a stranger, Elizabeth believes his “countenance may vouch” (78) for his good nature and later tells Jane that “there was truth in his looks” (83). He manipulates her by revealing the story in bits and pieces, occasionally changing the topic of their conversation—letting her “interest of the subject increase” (76), then coming back around to his sorrowful tale and claiming he has “no right to give my opinion” (75). Elizabeth, entranced by her first impression of him, fails to notice any of this.At the Netherfield ball, Elizabeth takes pleasure in finding “confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy’s look and behavior [sic]” (84) and even tells Charlotte she is “determined to hate” (88) him. She confronts Darcy about Wickham without asking to hear his side of the story, accusing him of being “blinded by prejudice” (90) and of holding too stubborn an opinion, something of which she herself is guilty. She tells Jane that Bingley, who defends Darcy, must be wrong because “he is unacquainted with several parts of the story” (93)—yet she herself is no more acquainted with the whole story than he is. In this way, Elizabeth demonstrates the very prejudice for which she faults Darcy.Darcy himself, when confronted by Elizabeth, exhibits the tactful discretion Wickham lacks by refraining from insulting Wickham the way Wickham insults him. When Elizabeth notes that Wickham has lost his friendship, Darcy “[makes] no answer, and [seems] desirous of changing the subject” (89). Elizabeth reminds him that he’d once told her that his “resentment once created was unappeasable” (90) and asks him whether he is “very cautious […] as to its being created” (90). Darcy replies simply, “I am” (90). Finally, after Elizabeth explains that she is trying to obtain a picture of his character, he warns her “not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either” (91). Darcy suggests that Elizabeth’s opinion is based on false information without explicitly saying so, thus sparing her embarrassment, avoiding censuring her, and retaining his composure. Just as with Mr. Collins, comparison between Wickham and Darcy leaves Darcy looking more favorable.Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins seek to impress the Bingley party, but their tactlessness and obsequiousness create the opposite effect. Mr. Collins begs Darcy’s pardon in not introducing himself sooner, blithely ignoring Elizabeth’s insistence that he will appear “impertinent” (94). Mrs. Bennet’s loud gushing over Bingley, and the brazen manipulation she employs to ensure they are the last to leave, only annoy Bingley’s sisters. With this unabashed worship of the wealthy, Austen exposes those who prove correct the criticisms of the haughty Bingley sisters.", "Volume 1, Chapter 19 Summary": "Mr. Collins asks Mrs. Bennet if he can speak privately with Elizabeth. She readily agrees, despite Elizabeth’s pleas that she not leave. Once alone, Mr. Collins commends Elizabeth’s modesty. He tells her he has chosen her to be his wife and proceeds to list his reasons for marrying. First, clergymen in “easy circumstances” should “set the example of matrimony in his parish” (101). Second, marriage will make him happy. Finally, Lady Catherine has graciously offered her opinion that he should marry a “useful” woman who was “not brought up high” (102). He assures her that her “wit and vivacity” will be “acceptable” to Lady Catherine “when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite” (102). He notes there is no shortage of women in his neighborhood but that he has chosen to marry one of the Bennets to alleviate their financial burden.Elizabeth interrupts to thank him and decline his proposal. Mr. Collins brushes off this rejection, stating women often decline proposals they intend to accept. Elizabeth promises she is sincere and that she would not jeopardize her happiness by rejecting a man she wanted to marry. She informs him he could never make her happy, nor she him, adding that Lady Catherine would not approve of her either. When Mr. Collins again refuses to accept her rejection, she asserts that he should feel no guilt inheriting the Longbourn estate when the time comes.Elizabeth rises to leave. Mr. Collins says her rejection is “consistent with the true delicacy of the female character” and that he hopes when they speak again, she has “a more favourable [sic] answer” (104). Elizabeth again denies that she is being modest. Mr. Collins claims she couldn’t possibly reject him, as his hand is not “unworthy your acceptance” given his “situation in life” and his “connections with the family of De Bourgh” (104). He warns that her own situation means she may not receive another proposal. Therefore he must conclude that she’s rejecting him in the hopes of “increasing my love by suspense” in the habit “of elegant females” (104).Elizabeth says she “would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere” (104), that she would like to be seen as “a rational creature speaking the truth” (105) rather than “an elegant female intending to plague you” (105). When he again denies her rejection, calling her “uniformly charming” (105), she runs from the room, hoping her father can get through to him.", "Volume 1, Chapter 20 Summary": "After Elizabeth flees the room, Mrs. Bennet congratulates Mr. Collins, who cheerfully tells her what happened and says he has “every reason to be satisfied” because Elizabeth’s rejections “naturally flow from her bashful modesty” (105). Shocked, Mrs. Bennet tells him she doesn’t believe Elizabeth “meant to encourage him” but that she will “be brought to reason” (106). She remarks that Elizabeth is “a very headstrong, foolish girl,” and Mr. Collins replies that if that’s true, she may not be a good wife “to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in a marriage state” (106). Panicking, Mrs. Bennet tells her husband that he must make Elizabeth marry Mr. Collins before he changes his mind. Elizabeth is summoned. Mrs. Bennet tells her she will never see her again if she doesn’t marry Mr. Collins; Mr. Bennet says he will never see her again if she does.Mrs. Bennet pleads with Elizabeth, who continues to refuse. Charlotte Lucas arrives, and Mrs. Bennet wails her sorrows, telling Elizabeth she is “undutiful,” that if she continues rejecting proposals no one will be able to take care of her, and that “nobody is on my side” (108).Alone with Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins says that “[r]esignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all” (109) and that he has begun to doubt whether he would have been happy with Elizabeth as his wife. He tells her that “resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation” (109) and that he hopes she does not feel it is disrespectful for him to withdraw his proposal. He concludes with an apology for accepting the rejection from Elizabeth herself rather than allowing her parents to intervene on his behalf.", "Volume 1, Chapter 21 Summary": "Mr. Collins does not avoid Elizabeth; rather, he exhibits his feelings with “stiffness of manner” and “resentful silence” (110). He spends the day speaking with Charlotte Lucas, and Elizabeth is grateful to Charlotte for distracting him. Mrs. Bennet continues to show her anger. Much to Elizabeth’s dismay, Mr. Collins doesn’t shorten his visit.The girls walk to Meryton, where Wickham joins them at Mrs. Philips’s house. Wickham tells Elizabeth that he deliberately stayed away from the Netherfield ball to avoid being in the same room as Darcy, which might have led to a scene. He pays special attention to her as he walks with them back to Longbourn. Elizabeth is happy to be singled out and also to introduce him to her parents.Jane receives an upsetting letter from Miss Bingley. She confides in Elizabeth that Miss Bingley says her brother has been called to London for business, that they’ve decided to follow him there, and that they do not intend to return the entire winter. She hopes Jane will write to her, that she enjoys her Christmas, and that her “beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss” (112). She adds that in London, they will have many opportunities to see Darcy’s sister Georgiana, who has no “equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments” (113); she confesses that she and her sister expect Miss Darcy will marry Bingley and asks if Jane feels it is wrong of her to “hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many” (113).Jane believes Miss Bingley thinks her brother is indifferent toward her and is trying to “most kindly” warn her. Elizabeth believes Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with Jane, prefers for him to marry Miss Darcy, and is trying to keep him and Jane apart. She says that Bingley’s love for Jane is obvious and that their family simply is “not rich enough or grand enough for them” (114). Jane insists Miss Bingley “is incapable of deceiving any one” and that it’s more likely that “she is deceived herself” (114). Elizabeth does not believe Bingley himself does not intend to return, that this is merely “Caroline’s interested wishes” (115).", "Volume 1, Chapter 22 Summary": "Charlotte continues to entertain Mr. Collins when the Bennets have dinner at the Lucas’s house, and Elizabeth expresses her gratitude. She has no idea that Charlotte is attempting to earn Mr. Collins’s affection and that she’s been “tolerably encouraging” (116) toward him.The next day, Mr. Collins sneaks away from Longbourn to propose; having been rejected once, he wants to avoid his cousins knowing of his proposal until it’s accepted. After his profuse speech, Charlotte accepts. He asks her to pick a date when she will “make him the happiest of men” (116-17); having “accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment,” Charlotte “cared not how soon” the wedding would take place (117).Sir William and Lady Lucas eagerly give their consent and are delighted that their daughter is marrying a man who will come into wealth. Lady Lucas wonders how long Mr. Bennet will live. The other Lucas daughters are happy to be able to enter society, and the Lucas sons are pleased they won’t have to support Charlotte in her old age. Charlotte herself accepts the situation with composure. Mr. Collins’s “society is irksome,” and he is “neither sensible nor agreeable” (117); however, “marriage had always been her object,” for though it is “uncertain of giving happiness,” it is “the only honorable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune” (117). As she is already 27 and not beautiful, Charlotte feels fortunate, though she fears the marriage will affect her cherished relationship with Elizabeth. She resolves to inform Elizabeth herself after Mr. Collins has departed Longbourn.Elizabeth is stunned by the news. Charlotte tells her she is “not romantic,” that she asks “only a comfortable home” (120),and that she has no less of a chance of happiness with him than with any other husband. Reflecting later, Elizabeth laments the “humiliating picture” of Charlotte marrying Mr. Collins; she believes her friend is “disgracing herself” by marrying him for “worldly advantage.” Doubting Charlotte will be happy, she feels Charlotte has “sunk in her esteem” (120).", "Volume 1, Chapter 23 Summary": "Sir William visits Longbourn to announce the news. The Bennets are unbelieving; Sir William’s “good-breeding” enables him to tolerate “their impertinence” (121). Elizabeth confirms his story, and she and Jane congratulate him.Mrs. Bennet remains mostly silent until he leaves, at which time she claims she doesn’t believe it, that Mr. Collins has been tricked, that he and Charlotte will never be happy, and that maybe they won’t get married after all. She complains that it’s Elizabeth’s fault and “that she herself [has] been barbarously used by them all” (121). She finds it difficult to speak to Elizabeth or the Lucases. Mr. Bennet is delighted to find that Charlotte, “whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter” (122). As Mr. Collins is a mere clergyman, Kitty and Lydia see the news as gossip and nothing more. Lady Lucas, in “triumph,” comes to Longbourn more frequently than usual to talk about “the comfort of having a daughter well married” (122).Elizabeth’s “disappointment in Charlotte” leads her to believe they will never have the same intimacy again, and she “turn[s] with fonder regard to her sister” (122). Meanwhile, Jane awaits a response from Miss Bingley, to whom she’d written after her last letter. Elizabeth fears that Bingley’s sisters will succeed in keeping him from returning. Jane prefers to hide her feelings and is tormented by Mrs. Bennet, who encourages her to confess “that if he [does] not come back she should think herself very ill used” (124).Mr. Collins returns and is less warmly received; thankfully for the Bennets, he spends most of his time with the Lucases. Mrs. Bennet cannot tolerate the sight of Charlotte, whom “[a]s her successor in that house,” she sees “with jealous abhorrence” (124). Mrs. Bennet believes Charlotte is biding her time until she comes into possession of Longbourn and that whenever she speaks quietly with Mr. Collins, they are discussing their plans “to turn herself and her daughters out of the house” (124).", "Volume 1, Chapters 19-23 Analysis": "Mr. Collins demonstrates a vision of women that is, at best, idealized and, at worst, dehumanizing. He sees women as vapid and delicate, describing how he pleases Miss de Bourgh with “those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies” (66). He scolds Lydia for failing to read sermons on proper women’s behavior. Upon meeting the Bennet daughters, his first observation is that their beauty undoubtedly ensures that they will be “well disposed of in marriage” (63). In choosing a wife, he assesses the Bennet daughters in the same manner he assesses their furniture: as “future property” (64). Most importantly, he insists Elizabeth’s rejections are a sign of her “bashful modesty” (105). This declaration shows how little Mr. Collins understands Elizabeth and, therefore, the way marriage is often conducted as business. Despite her insistence that she “is not one of those young ladies” (103) who keep suitors in suspense, he insists her rejection is “the usual practice of elegant females” (104), a claim that coordinates with his vision of the ideal woman (and, incidentally, prevents him from having to consider that her rejection has something to do with him). This vision is confirmed by his statements to Mrs. Bennet that if Elizabeth is indeed a “headstrong” girl (106), she cannot possibly make him happy. Though Elizabeth begs to be treated as a “rational creature” (105), he refuses to give weight to her thoughts. He assures her that her “wit and vivacity” (102) will be acceptable to his patron “when tempered” (102), and in his desire for a pliant wife, he contrasts once again with Darcy, who is attracted to Elizabeth because of, not in spite of, this vivacity. Mr. Collins’s inability to accept her rejection demonstrates the male-dominated system that leaves women powerless. Though conceited, Mr. Collins isn’t entirely wrong when he states that the Bennets’ modest financial situation means that “it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you” (104). Mr. Collins remains incredulous about Elizabeth’s rejection because his lofty position should attract a woman whose future remains uncertain. He is so certain of his power over her that he calls her rejection “evil” (109). Elizabeth’s intention “to apply to her father,” (105) who, as a man, will be taken more seriously, demonstrates the degree to which women are disenfranchised and disempowered.The fact that Mr. Collins finds so willing a wife in Charlotte Lucas is evidence that the power he esteems himself to hold is not imagined. The Lucases, who can “give little fortune” (117) to Charlotte and whose sons fear they’ll have to take care of her, are delighted by her engagement to Mr. Collins. Charlotte, though believing Mr. Collins “irksome,” feels fortunate for this “preservative from want” (117). By making marriage her “object” (117), she submits to the system and accepts what she feels is the best she can hope for. Elizabeth is disappointed to see her friend “disgracing herself” for “worldly advantage” (120). However, Charlotte has reason to thus assess her choices. Elizabeth’s expectation may be more than what society can give her.Similarly, Mrs. Bennet’s jealousy of Charlotte, and her bitterness toward Charlotte inheriting Longbourn, seems justified by Lady Lucas’s calculating how much longer Mr. Bennet is likely to live. In a system in which women assess their monetary value and settle in unhappy marriages, Mrs. Bennet’s fear and resentment—though histrionic—are understandable. Mrs. Bennet is willing to sacrifice Elizabeth’s happiness for financial security.", "Volume 2, Chapter 1 Summary": "Jane receives a letter from Miss Bingley reiterating their intention to stay in London through the winter and praising Miss Darcy, whom she believes will marry Bingley. With this letter, “[h]ope was over, entirely over” (129). Elizabeth is indignant. She believes Bingley truly loves Jane and that his “easiness of temper” makes him “the slave of his designing friends” (129). She feels he’s entitled to sacrifice his own happiness if he chooses but can’t forgive him for sacrificing her sister’s, too.Mrs. Bennet continues to complain, to the annoyance of Jane and Elizabeth. Jane insists she will be over Bingley soon and that she simply misinterpreted Bingley’s feelings; Elizabeth tells her she is “angelic” and “too good” (130). She goes on to say that “[t]he more I see of the world, the more I am dissatisfied with it” (131) and that “every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters” (131). Jane, sensing Elizabeth is referring to Bingley and Charlotte, pleads with her not to think thoughts that “will ruin [her] happiness” (131) and to remember that people’s circumstances sometimes dictate their behavior. Elizabeth tells Jane that if Charlotte actually loved Mr. Collins, she’d be even more disappointed in her.Jane states that sometimes young men inadvertently hurt women and that women’s vanity makes them see more in a relationship than exists. Elizabeth responds that “[t]houghtlessness” (132) can be just as harmful. When Elizabeth says again that Bingley’s sisters are behind his leaving, Jane argues there’s no reason for them not to put his happiness first. Elizabeth disagrees, saying they would rather he marry a wealthy girl than be happy. Jane tells her that if Bingley really loved her, his sisters wouldn’t be able to part them. She says she is “not ashamed of having been mistaken” (132) and begs Elizabeth to let her see it in “the best light” (133). Elizabeth respects her wishes and says no more about Bingley.Mr. Bennet jokes that being crossed in love is a rite of passage and hopes Elizabeth’s turn comes soon, perhaps with Wickham. Wickham visits frequently, and his presence is a relief to the family. His accusations against Darcy are now common knowledge, and “every body [is] pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter” (134). Darcy is “condemned as the worst of men” (134).", "Volume 2, Chapter 2 Summary": "Mrs. Bennet’s brother and sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, visit Longbourn from London. They are “sensible” and “well bred” (134), much loved by the Bennets and particularly by Jane and Elizabeth. Mrs. Bennet laments that she almost had two daughters married; she doesn’t blame Jane but is still frustrated with Elizabeth. Also, she feels “[t]he Lucases are very artful people indeed” (135).Privately, Mrs. Gardiner tells Elizabeth that young men frequently fall in and out of love. Elizabeth responds that in this case, “the interference of friends” (136) hastened his leaving. Mrs. Gardiner suggests that Bingley was not as “violently in love” (136) as they’d thought, though Elizabeth believes she’d never seen “a more promising inclination” (136). Mrs. Gardiner suggests that Jane stay with them for a while, though she worries that Jane will hope to run into Bingley and they “live in so different a part of town” (136). Elizabeth assures her Darcy won’t allow him to visit and that Miss Bingley will probably stop communicating with Jane completely. However, part of her still hopes Bingley will remain in love with Jane and will be able to overcome his sisters’ influence. Jane accepts the Gardiners’ invitation and hopes she’ll be able to see Miss Bingley without running into her brother.Mrs. Gardiner observes Elizabeth and Wickham together during one of the many get-togethers at Longbourn. She doesn’t believe them to be in love but feels “uneasy” about their obvious “preference of each other” (137). She enjoys talking with Wickham about Derbyshire, where she’d spent time as a child and where Pemberley, Darcy’s estate, is located. Because Wickham’s father had served Darcy’s father, Wickham spent much time there, too, and is able to “give her fresher intelligence of her former friends.” When Mrs. Gardiner is told about Darcy’s ill treatment of Wickham, she “trie[s] to remember something of that gentleman’s reputed disposition” (138) as a child to support these claims; finally she feels sure “that she recollects having heard” (138) that he’d been “a very proud, ill-natured boy” (138).", "Volume 2, Chapter 3 Summary": "Mrs. Gardiner tells Elizabeth she is “too sensible […] to fall in love merely because you are warned against it” (139) and that she therefore needs to warn her against a relationship with Wickham. As neither Elizabeth nor Wickham have great fortune, a match between them would be “imprudent.” However, she believes Elizabeth “could not do better” (139) if he had more of a fortune.Elizabeth says she isn’t in love with Wickham but that he is “the most agreeable man I ever saw” (139). Though she does “see the imprudence of it” (139), many young people fall in love despite lack of fortune, and she can’t “promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures” (139). She can promise only “not to be in a hurry” (139). Elizabeth agrees to dissuade Mrs. Bennet from inviting him over, and the conversation ends amicably and with mutual respect.Charlotte and Mr. Collins marry, and before departing for Hunsford, Charlotte says her father and sister are visiting in March and that she’d like Elizabeth to join them. After the wedding, Charlotte and Elizabeth write frequently, but Elizabeth feels that “it [is] for the sake of what had been rather than what [is]” (141). They can no longer be “unreserved,” and their former “intimacy” is gone (141). Charlotte writes “cheerfully” (141) of her home and neighborhood, and Elizabeth feels she’ll know the full situation when she visits.Jane writes to Elizabeth from London, expressing her surprise that she and Miss Bingley have failed to connect; she believes her letter informing Miss Bingley of her being in town must have been lost. Elizabeth doesn’t agree that the letter was lost and fears Bingley will never know Jane is in London. Finally Jane writes that Miss Bingley visited her, that her coldness makes it impossible for Jane to “deceive herself” (142) further, and that only fear of “judging harshly” prevents her from suspecting “duplicity” (143). She also writes that Miss Bingley told her they likely will not ever return to Netherfield. Elizabeth hopes Bingley marries Miss Darcy “as a punishment” (144), for if Wickham is right and Miss Darcy is proud, she will make Bingley unhappy.Mrs. Gardiner writes to Elizabeth to ask about Wickham. Elizabeth responds that he is now “the admirer of someone else” (144) who can offer him £10,000. Elizabeth’s easy acceptance of the situation shows her that she wasn’t in love with him, and she doesn’t blame him or Miss King, the young lady in question.", "Volume 2, Chapter 4 Summary": "January and February pass, and Elizabeth plans to visit Charlotte in March. She is excited to see Charlotte and doesn’t mind leaving her mother and “uncompanionable sisters” (145). Also, they will spend a night in London, which will give her a chance to see Jane. Her only regret is leaving her father, who asks her to write.She and Wickham part amiably; he remembers that she’d been “the first to excite and deserve his attention” and also “the first to listen and to pity” (146). Elizabeth feels that no matter what happens, “he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing” (146).Elizabeth, Sir William, and Maria Lucas arrive at the Gardiners’ house and are warmly greeted. Elizabeth is glad to see Jane looking well. Elizabeth hears from Mrs. Gardiner that Jane suffers “periods of dejection” but that she has “given up the acquaintance” with Miss Bingley (147).Mrs. Gardiner worries that Wickham has become attached to Miss King because of her fortune, especially since Wickham seemed not to pay any attention to her until she inherited the money. Elizabeth asks, “If she does not object to it, why should we?” (147). Mrs. Gardiner replies, “Her not objecting does not justify him” (147). Elizabeth says she is “sick” of young men from Derbyshire and Hertfordshire; Mrs. Gardiner warns her that “that speech savours [sic] strongly of disappointment” (148).Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner ask Elizabeth if she’d like to join them on a tour of the Lakes District in the summer; Elizabeth is overjoyed to accept. She expresses her desire to bid “[a]dieu to disappointment,” asking, “‘What are men to rocks and mountains?’” (148).", "Volume 2, Chapter 5 Summary": "The party arrives at Hunsford. Mr. Collins is as profuse and “ostentatious” (148) as always. Mr. Collins shows them around their home, and Elizabeth has the impression that when he describes the comforts of the house, he is speaking specifically to her. Elizabeth is impressed with Charlotte’s endurance: whenever Mr. Collins says something embarrassing, “Charlotte wisely [does] not hear” (150). Mr. Collins takes them to the garden and explains that he finds great pleasure in gardening. Charlotte says she “encourage[s] it as much as possible” (150).When Mr. Collins and Sir William continue walking in the garden, the women turn back to the house. Charlotte shows them around, and Elizabeth feels that “[w]hen Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout” (151).Mr. Collins tells Elizabeth that she “will have the honour [sic] of seeing” (151) Lady Catherine on Sunday. He says Lady Catherine, who is “all affability and condescension” (151), treats Charlotte very well and that they eat dinner at Rosings twice a week, and that Lady Catherine always lets them ride home in one of her carriages. Charlotte comments that Lady Catherine is “a most attentive neighbor” (151). In her room that night, Elizabeth considers that Charlotte’s “composure in bearing” Mr. Collins is “all done very well” (151).The next day, Maria calls Elizabeth downstairs: Miss de Bourgh and her caretaker are in a carriage outside, and Mr. Collins and Charlotte are talking to them. Elizabeth notes that Miss de Bourgh is “thin and small,” and also “abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind” (152).She thinks Miss de Bourgh, who “looks sickly and cross,” will make Darcy “a very proper wife” (152).When Mr. Collins and Charlotte return inside, Mr. Collins congratulates the women “on their good fortune” (153), for they have been invited to dine at Rosings the following evening.", "Volume 2, Chapter 6 Summary": "The invitation to Rosings is a “triumph” for Mr. Collins, who shows off “the grandeur of his patroness” as well as “her civility towards himself and his wife” (153). He claims that his “knowledge of her affability” (153) led him to expect that they would be invited to tea but not to dinner. Sir William responds that he is not surprised, for his “situation in life” has provided “knowledge of what the manners of the great really are” (153). Mr. Collins spends the day “carefully instructing them in what they [are] to expect” (153) and assures Elizabeth there is no need to make herself “uneasy” over her clothes because Lady Catherine “likes to have the distinction of rank preserved” (154).As they walk to Rosings, Mr. Collins describes how much the windows cost. Maria Lucas is intimidated. Elizabeth has heard nothing of Lady Catherine having “extraordinary talents or virtues” and is not impressed by “mere stateliness of money and rank” (154).Charlotte makes the introductions, thereby avoiding Mr. Collins’s “apologies and thanks” (155). Sir William and Maria are awed silent. Elizabeth finds Lady Catherine’s manners not “such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank” (155). She feels Wickham described her perfectly. Miss de Bough is shockingly frail and says little.During dinner, Mr. Collins is exceedingly proud to sit at the foot of the table. He and Sir William offer Lady Catherine profuse compliments, and Elizabeth wonders if Lady Catherine will find them insincere. However, Lady Catherine seems pleased by the compliments and by the fact that the dishes are “a novelty to them” (156). After dinner, Lady Catherine monopolizes the conversation, “delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as prove[s] that she [is] not used to have her judgment controverted” (156). She tells Charlotte how to handle all her domestic affairs. She also asks Elizabeth personal questions, and Elizabeth answers them, though she “[feels] all the impertinence of her questions” (157). Many of Lady Catherine’s inquiries come with a reminder of her own superior rank and the Bennets’ lesser fortune. She tells Elizabeth that if she had known her mother, she would have encouraged her to hire a governess. When Lady Catherine asks Elizabeth her age, Elizabeth slyly declines to answer, further shocking her.They play cards, and Elizabeth’s table is “superlatively stupid” (159). Lady Catherine, at the other table, draws attention to everyone’s mistakes and talks about herself. Mr. Collins apologizes for winning too much.They return home, and Mr. Collins asks Elizabeth to share her opinion. She exaggerates “for Charlotte’s sake” (160). Mr. Collins, unsatisfied, chimes in with his own praise.", "Volume 2, Chapters 1-6 Analysis": "Elizabeth witnesses sad conclusions for two women she cares about. Her statement to Jane that “[t]he more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it” (131) demonstrates her disillusionment. Disappointed in Charlotte’s settling for Mr. Collins, Elizabeth feels that “all the comfort of intimacy” (141) with her is gone. She also thinks with “anger” about Bingley’s “easiness of temper” (129), which makes him susceptible to his sisters’ influence. Despite her skepticism, Elizabeth has demonstrated a kind of romanticism. What she sees as the failure of sense in those around her gives her an unpleasant look at “the inconsistency of all human characters” (131).However, Elizabeth is also vulnerable to inconsistency and the failure to use “sense” and “good conduct” (139). Mrs. Gardiner is immediately established as a voice of logic, “an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman” (135). Yet Elizabeth does not consider that Mrs. Gardiner’s wariness of Wickham is another sign that his looks are deceiving. When Mrs. Gardiner questions Wickham’s motivation for attaching himself to the newly-wealthy Miss King, Elizabeth defends his mercenary behavior, insisting it’s understandable for “[a] man in distressed circumstances” (147). Her defense of Wickham contrasts with her criticism of Charlotte, who “sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage” (120). She demonstrates similar vulnerability to prejudice in her hope that Bingley’s “punishment” (144) will be to marry Miss Darcy; she thinks Miss Darcy will “make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away” (144), though she doesn’t know her at all.Despite her prejudice in regard to Wickham and Darcy, Elizabeth retains a healthy discernment of Lady Catherine and the blind reverence of wealth demonstrated by Mr. Collins and Sir William, who compete with each other to prove they know more than the other of “the manners of the great” (153). Despite Mr. Collins’s praise, Lady Catherine’s “mere stateliness of money and rank” (154) does not impress Elizabeth. Lady Catherine is arrogant and condescending, with little to commend her. At dinner, she “[does] not supply much conversation” (156); in the drawing room, she monopolizes the conversation with her own opinions and criticisms. The conversation at cards is no better: at Elizabeth’s table, “[s]carcely a syllable [is] uttered that [does] not relate to the game” (159), while Lady Catherine continues her haughty criticism at the next table. Though Mr. Collins considers that his seat “at the bottom of the table” is evidence “that life could furnish nothing greater,” Elizabeth desires more than being allowed into a wealthy woman’s presence (156). She has no trouble answering Lady Catherine’s intrusive personal questions with equal assuredness. She “[can] hardly help smiling” (158) while honestly answering Lady Catherine’s shocked exclamations about the Bennets’ lack of governess. Lady Catherine demonstrates the ill manners she presumes in her visitors. Her daughter’s physical fragility seems to represent Lady Catherine’s fragile ego, which makes her incapable of accepting disagreement of any kind.Like Mr. Bennet, whose joking enables him to tolerate the melodrama of his wife, Charlotte survives her tedious life with Mr. Collins by encouraging him to garden outside as much as possible. Elizabeth’s acknowledgment of Charlotte’s masterful compromises—when she considers Charlotte’s “enjoyment” of her home, she understands that “it [is] all done very well” (151)—suggests her willingness to adjust her thinking when offered new information.", "Volume 2, Chapter 7 Summary": "Sir William stays a week at Hunsford, leaving satisfied that his daughter is well taken care of. Elizabeth and Maria remain with Charlotte. Elizabeth wonders why Charlotte has chosen a small room in the back of the house as a sitting room but realizes the wisdom of the choice when she sees that Mr. Collins would have joined her in the room if it were more pleasant. He prefers to sit in the front of the house, where he has a clear view of the lane; he frequently comes to tell Charlotte when Miss de Bourgh passes in her phaeton.Lady Catherine visits at times and always finds much to criticize in Charlotte’s furniture, housemaid, and food. Mr. Collins tells her when cottagers are arguing or struggling financially, and she calls on them “to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty” (161).They dine at Rosings a couple of times a week. Elizabeth enjoys talking with Charlotte and going for walks. When Charlotte and Mr. Collins visit Lady Catherine, Elizabeth likes to walk along a path that no one else takes.After a couple of weeks, Elizabeth hears that Darcy is expected to arrive at Rosings. She feels his presence will add novelty to their dinners. She is also curious how he will interact with Miss de Bourgh. Lady Catherine is disappointed that Elizabeth and Charlotte already know him, as she won’t be able to introduce him to them herself.When Darcy arrives, Mr. Collins knows immediately, having spent the entire morning watching the road. Mr. Collins visits the following morning and, to everyone’s surprise, returns with Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam, Darcy’s cousin, who is staying with him at Rosings. Charlotte thanks Elizabeth, feeling they wouldn’t have visited had it not been for her presence.Colonel Fitzwilliam is friendly and amiable. Darcy greets them “with his usual reserve” and “every appearance of composure” (163). Colonel Fitzwilliam participates in conversation “with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man” (163); Darcy says little, finally asking Elizabeth about her family’s health. Elizabeth answers him and asks if he has seen Jane, who has been in London for three months, knowing he hasn’t but curious to see his response. He says he has not had the pleasure of seeing her.", "Volume 2, Chapter 8 Summary": "When the Collins party next dines at Rosings, Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam interact “with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy” (164). Lady Catherine asks what they’re talking about; Colonel Fitzwilliam tells her they’re discussing music. Lady Catherine says she enjoys music more than anyone in England. She asks Darcy if his sister is a good musician; he says she is, and Lady Catherine insists he tell her she must practice. Darcy replies that “she does not need such advice” (165). Lady Catherine goes on to say that she’s told Elizabeth she can practice on her piano any time and that she won’t be a bother in that part of the house. Darcy “look[s] a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill breeding, and [makes] no answer” (165).After dinner, Colonel Fitzwilliam asks Elizabeth to play the piano. Lady Catherine begins speaking to Darcy, who walks away and stands by the piano where Elizabeth can clearly see him. Elizabeth, smiling, says she knows he’s trying to scare her and that her “stubbornness” prevents her from being intimidated. Darcy replies that she doesn’t truly believe he wants to scare her and that he knows she finds “great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact, are not your own” (166). Laughing, Elizabeth says it’s unwise of him to try to “expose my real character,” for she may “retaliate” by saying things that “will shock your relations to hear” (166).Darcy, also smiling, tells her he’s “not afraid” of her, and Colonel Fitzwilliam begs her to elaborate. Elizabeth playfully tells him that at the Meryton ball, Darcy danced only four dances. When Darcy says he didn’t know anyone, Elizabeth jokes that of course “nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room” (167). Darcy says he is “ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers” and can’t speak “easily with those I have not seen before” (167). Elizabeth counters that she isn’t the best piano player, but it’s her own fault because she doesn’t practice. Darcy tells her no one listening could find fault with her playing and that “[w]e neither of us perform to strangers” (167).Lady Catherine interrupts, saying her daughter would have been excellent on the piano had her health allowed it. She criticizes Elizabeth until the carriage takes them home.", "Volume 2, Chapter 9 Summary": "The next day, when Charlotte and Maria are out, Elizabeth is surprised by a visit from Darcy. After exchanging pleasantries, they sit in silence. Out of desperation, Elizabeth says Bingley left Netherfield quickly and that he must be glad Darcy and his sisters joined him. She adds she has heard that Bingley intends never to return; Darcy says he wouldn’t be surprised. Elizabeth says if that’s true, he should give up the house. Darcy suspects he will.They fall into silence again, and Elizabeth says nothing, forcing him to open another conversation. Darcy comments that the house seems comfortable and that Lady Catherine fixed it up for Mr. Collins; Elizabeth says Lady Catherine “could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object” (169). At Darcy’s comment that Mr. Collins “appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife” (169), Elizabeth replies that Charlotte is “one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him” (170).Elizabeth doesn’t believe Charlotte marrying Mr. Collins is “the wisest thing she ever did,” but Charlotte is “perfectly happy” and the marriage is good “in a prudential light” (170).Charlotte and Maria return and are surprised to find Darcy there. After he leaves, Charlotte says Darcy must be in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth’s description of the awkward silences makes Charlotte change her mind, and they agree he must have had nothing else to do.Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam visit frequently. While it’s clear Colonel Fitzwilliam comes because he enjoys their company, nobody knows why Darcy visits, for he rarely speaks, and when he does, “it seem[s] the effect of necessity rather than of choice” (171).Charlotte believes Darcy has feelings for Elizabeth, but Elizabeth laughs at her suggestion. Charlotte says no more about it because she doesn’t want to disappoint her if it isn’t true. However, she believes Elizabeth’s “dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power” (172). Sometimes she imagines Elizabeth marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam, who is friendlier; however, Darcy is by far the wealthier, more powerful man.", "Volume 2, Chapters 7-11,  Volume 2, Chapter 10 Summary": "Elizabeth frequently meets Darcy on her walks in the park. In order to avoid this awkwardness, she tells him it’s her favorite place to walk and finds it “very odd” that it continues to happen. She wonders if it’s “willful ill-nature” or “voluntary penance” (173) that makes him walk with her. Though much of their time together is spent in silence, he asks her questions and, at one point, seems to suggest that next time she is in Kent, she will stay at Rosings. Elizabeth wonders if he expects her to marry Colonel Fitzwilliam.One day she encounters Colonel Fitzwilliam on her walk. After a brief discussion in which he tells her he and Darcy are leaving Saturday, Colonel Fitzwilliam mentions that he and Darcy share custody of Miss Darcy. Elizabeth asks if Miss Darcy gives them “much trouble,” for if she’s anything like her brother, “she may like to have her own way” (175). At Colonel Fitzwilliam’s puzzled look, Elizabeth assures him she’s never heard anything negative about Miss Darcy, who is well-liked by Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst.Colonel Fitzwilliam reveals that Darcy told him that he recently “saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage” (175-76) and that he took the friend to be Bingley. Elizabeth asks the reason; Colonel Fitzwilliam replies that “there were some very strong objections against the lady” (176). Elizabeth, furious, asks “what right Mr. Darcy [has] to decide on the propriety of his friend’s inclination” (176) but then calms herself and changes the subject.Back in her room, she can think of nothing but the fact that Darcy has caused “all that Jane had suffered, and still continue[s] to suffer” (177), that he dashed the hopes of “the most affectionate, generous heart in the world” (177). She believes Darcy could have no objections to Jane and concludes that he was motivated partly by her family’s circumstances and partly by his desire for his sister to marry Bingley. Her crying brings on a headache, and she doesn’t join the Collinses at Rosings.", "Volume 2, Chapter 11 Summary": "Elizabeth rereads Jane’s letters. Finding Jane’s tone tinged with disappointment, she is glad Darcy is leaving Rosings the day after next and that she’ll soon be with Jane.Her thoughts are interrupted by a visit from Darcy, who tells her that despite his efforts, his “feelings will not be repressed” (179). He states, “You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you” (179). Stunned, Elizabeth listens as he talks of “the family obstacles” with just as much “warmth” as he talks of his love for her (179). He laments her “inferiority” and how being in love with her is “a degradation” (179). Elizabeth can’t help but feel flattered by his affection and would have felt “sorry for the pain he was to receive” (179); however, her sympathy vanishes as he talks of his love growing “in spite of all his endeavours [sic]” (179). She is even more indignant when she sees he has no doubt she will accept his marriage proposal.Elizabeth tells him she has “never desired your good opinion,” which he has clearly related “most unwillingly,” and that she expects that his reservations about her family will help dissipate the pain of rejection (180). With “forced calmness,” Darcy demands to know why he is rejected without even an “endeavour [sic] at civility” (180).Elizabeth responds that he was uncivil by telling her he has tried not to love her and that she could never be with the man who ruined her sister’s happiness. She is angered when Darcy seems “wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse” (181) and admits he did “every thing in my power” (181) to keep Jane and Bingley apart. When Elizabeth chastises him for his treatment of Wickham, Darcy expresses outrage that this is her opinion of him. He suggests that perhaps if he hadn’t wounded her pride—if he had “flattered” her by telling her his feelings were “unqualified”—she would have “suppressed” these “bitter accusations.” He tells her dishonesty is his “abhorrence” and that his concerns about her inferior “connections” are natural (182).Furious, Elizabeth assures him his presentation prevented her only from feeling guilty for hurting him, that from their first meeting she believed him selfish and insensitive. Darcy replies that he “perfectly comprehend[s]” and that he is “ashamed” of his feelings (183). After he leaves, Elizabeth cries for a half hour, then rushes to her room when the Collinses return.", "Volume 2, Chapters 7-11 Analysis": "These chapters contain the climax of Pride and Prejudice, the moment of highest tension and emotion, which leads to the falling action and the resolution of the conflict. This moment comes when Darcy confesses his love for Elizabeth and Elizabeth, in turn, reveals all the reasons for her resentment of him. This scene also reiterates that Elizabeth, who accuses Darcy of pride and prejudice, is not guiltless herself.Elizabeth has been so prejudiced against Darcy that she has failed to notice the obvious signs of his love—and that they have many similarities. She’s surprised when Darcy, who at the Netherfield ball barely tolerated Mr. Collins, returns with Mr. Collins to Hunsford. She marvels when she continues to meet Darcy on her walks, considering every reason except the reality, that he’s going out of his way to meet her. At Rosings, they playfully tease each other, exchanging intelligent, sometimes ironic banter, and slyly smiling at each other as they do. These conversations are in direct contrast with the conversations Elizabeth is accustomed to at Rosings and provide the intellectual stimulation for which she yearns. During one conversation, Darcy remarks, “We neither of us perform to strangers” (167)—a shrewd observation that casts the two of them almost as part of a team.Though Darcy undoubtedly has proven himself proud, a picture of a man who is perhaps not so much rude as socially inept emerges. When Elizabeth playfully chides him for not speaking to anyone at the Meryton ball, Darcy responds that he had not had “at that time the honour [sic] of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party” and that he is “ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers” (167). He proves this true in the days to come when he visits Hunsford frequently but baffles the household by sitting in silence, only occasionally engaging in awkward conversation. Elizabeth does not consider that he’s taken her criticism seriously, that he’s put himself in uneasy situations, all for her sake. The fact that his conversation flows so freely with Elizabeth is a sign of his comfort with her.The proposal scene is significant because Darcy and Elizabeth clearly demonstrate the pride and prejudice that have led them to this point. Darcy speaks as much of the “degradation” of “her inferiority” (179) as he does of his love for her. He has “no doubt of a favourable [sic] answer” (180) and is surprised when she rejects him, thus demonstrating the pride she’s accused him of since the beginning. Elizabeth, already inclined to think the worst of him, chastises him for causing Wickham’s destitution. She openly admits to her prejudice, telling Darcy that “from the first moment […] of my acquaintance with you,” she’d felt he was “the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry” (183). She accuses him of the prejudice she herself exhibits—whereas proud Darcy suggests she might have responded to his proposal differently had he not wounded her pride.Though Darcy’s shock at being rejected is reminiscent of Lady Catherine, who is unused to disagreement and is “quite astonished” (159) by Elizabeth’s honesty, he frequently distinguishes himself from his proud aunt. When Lady Catherine requests that he tell his sister to practice the piano, Darcy responds “that she does not need such advice” (165). When Lady Catherine instructs Elizabeth to practice, Darcy “look[s] a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill breeding” (165). When Lady Catherine speaks to Darcy in the middle of Elizabeth’s song, Darcy moves away from her and positions himself “so as to command a full view” (165-66) of Elizabeth. His refusal to humor Lady Catherine when he deems her behavior inappropriate confirms his penchant for honesty and suggests that while pride prevents him from revealing his feelings sooner, his motives are not as selfish as Elizabeth thinks.", "Volume 2, Chapter 12 Summary": "The next morning, Elizabeth goes for a walk and encounters Darcy, who hands her a letter and walks away. She opens the letter and reads it where she stands.Darcy begins by assuring her he doesn’t intend to propose again. He apologizes for requiring her time, adding that he knows she “will bestow it unwillingly” but that he “demand[s] it of your justice” (185).He writes that, like everyone else, he’d noticed Bingley was in love with Jane. After hearing a marriage was imminent, he observed them carefully. While Jane was “open, cheerful, and engaging” (186), she didn’t seem especially interested in Bingley. If Elizabeth disagrees, he writes, he “must have been in error” (186). He admits to hoping they wouldn’t marry but insists he did not make decisions based on his hopes. Her family’s lack of connection was less a concern than their “total want of propriety” (187). He apologizes for offending her and compliments her and Jane for “conducting yourselves so as to avoid any share of the censure” (187).Bingley had been planning to return to Netherfield, but Darcy and Bingley’s sisters convinced him to stay in London. Darcy’s concerns regarding Jane’s family wouldn’t have convinced Bingley to end the relationship had not it been for his more important suggestion that she didn’t reciprocate Bingley’s feelings. Darcy’s only regret is that he hid Jane’s presence in London from Bingley. He apologizes for hurting Jane but not for doing what he thought was right.Darcy begins his discussion of Wickham by stating that “Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man” (188) who was in charge of the Pemberley estates. Darcy’s father gave Wickham an education and intended to provide him a career in the church. Darcy, unlike his father, noticed “want of principle” (189) in Wickham.In his will, Darcy’s father requested that Darcy ensure Wickham receive his living. When Wickham declined the living in the church and asked that he be paid a sum of money instead, Darcy conceded, knowing Wickham “ought not to be a clergyman” (189). After three years living “a life of idleness and dissipation” (190), Wickham approached Darcy to request the church living. Darcy refused.He heard nothing from Wickham until last summer, when Wickham attempted to elope with Darcy’s 15-year-old sister, who believed herself in love; however, Darcy discovered them first. Darcy believes Wickham’s actions were motivated by his desire for revenge, as well as his sister’s fortune.Darcy hopes Elizabeth will “acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham” (191). He says Colonel Fitzwilliam can verify everything he’s written and that if “your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless” (191), she at least should believe his cousin.", "Volume 2, Chapter 13 Summary": "Elizabeth, “[w]ith a strong prejudice against everything he might say” (192), reads the letter with so much interest she can barely absorb each sentence. She dismisses the claim that he did not know Jane was in love with Bingley and is offended by his assessment of her family. When she reads about what transpired between Darcy and Wickham, she is so shocked she dismisses Darcy’s account of these events as false. However, reading the letter again, she slowly realizes that it’s possible Darcy is blameless.She thinks about how no one had heard of Wickham before he came to Meryton. Though his appearance and charm “had established him at once in the possession of every virtue,” she cannot think of any “instance of goodness” that might prove Darcy’s accusations unfounded (194). She recalls her conversation with Wickham at Mrs. Philips’s house and realizes how inappropriate it was for him to tell such a story to a stranger. Though he’d claimed not to fear Darcy, he’d “avoided the Netherfield ball that very week” (195). She now looks at his attachment to Miss King as “solely and hatefully mercenary” (195).As Elizabeth remembers all this, “[e]very lingering struggle” to redeem Wickham “[grows] fainter” (195). Of Darcy, she admits that, “proud and repulsive as were his manners,” she had never “seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust” (195). Had Wickham’s accusations about Darcy been true, the truth would have been widely known, and “such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley” (196) would not have been so friendly with him.She is “ashamed of herself” for having been “blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd” despite having “always prided [her]self on [her] discernment” (196). It is a “humiliating” but “just” realization (196). She states that “[t]ill this moment, [she] never knew [her]self” (196).Darcy’s explanation of his intervention in Bingley and Jane’s relationship now appears very different. Elizabeth believes if Darcy was so reasonable in one case, he’s likely to be reasonable in another, and she remembers Charlotte’s warning that Jane didn’t demonstrate enough affection. Darcy’s comments about her family are true, and Elizabeth is “depressed beyond any thing she [has] ever known before” (197) to consider that her own family had caused Jane’s heartbreak.", "Volume 2, Chapter 14 Summary": "Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam leave Rosings. Lady Catherine requests the entire Collins party go to Rosings for dinner because she is so sad for their absence. She says that “‘nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do’” (198),and that her nephews were sad to leave, too. Elizabeth smiles when she thinks that under different circumstances, she “might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece” (198) and wonders what Lady Catherine’s reaction would have been.Lady Catherine notices that Elizabeth doesn’t seem herself and suggests that if she’s also sad to leave soon, she should ask her mother if she can stay longer because “there can be no occasion for your going so soon” (199). When Elizabeth says she must return home, Lady Catherine insists she and Maria have a servant accompany them, as “[i]t is highly improper” (199) for them to go themselves. Elizabeth says her uncle is sending someone to go with them.In the following days, Elizabeth walks alone as much as she is able, so she can “indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections” (200); these walks are her “greatest relief” (200). She learns Darcy’s letter by heart. When she thinks of how “she had condemned and upbraided him” (200), she feels sympathy for him and gratitude for his affection. She regrets how she’s acted and is ashamed of “the unhappy defects of her family” (200). Her father refuses to “restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters” (200), choosing to laugh at them, instead; her mother not only refuses to “check the imprudence” (201) of Kitty and Lydia but encourages it, thus ensuring it will never change. Most troubling to her is that Bingley’s affection was sincere and that Jane has suffered disappointment through no fault of Bingley himself but because of her family.Elizabeth dines at Rosings with the Collinses on her final night. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth and Maria how to pack; back at Hunsford, Maria unpacks and repacks her bag.", "Volume 2, Chapter 15 Summary": "On the morning of Elizabeth’s departure, Mr. Collins finds her alone and offers heartfelt thanks for visiting their “humble abode,” which may seem “extremely dull to a young lady like yourself” (202). He knows Charlotte appreciates it, and they are “grateful for the condescension” (202). Elizabeth tells him she enjoyed her visit and that she herself is grateful. Mr. Collins expresses his happiness at her happiness and says he feels fortunate that it was “in our power to introduce you to very superior society” (202). He hopes she will offer a positive report to those in Hertfordshire, having seen “Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins” (203). He also hopes “it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate” (203) and that Elizabeth herself finds “equal felicity in marriage” (203). Elizabeth tells him “with equal sincerity […] that she firmly believe[s] and rejoice[s] in his domestic comforts” (203).Charlotte enters the room, and Elizabeth is sorry to leave her “to such society” (203); however, she knows Charlotte “had chosen it with her eyes open” (203), that she “[does] not seem to ask for compassion” (203), and that she takes pleasure in her home.After Mr. Collins assures Elizabeth and Maria that he will pass their gratitude along to Rosings, the two women leave and, a few hours later, arrive at Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s house. Elizabeth conceals her news from Jane with effort. She decides to wait until they return to Longbourn, for she isn’t sure how much to reveal and is worried that telling what she knows of Bingley’s feelings “might only grieve her sister further” (204).", "Volume 2, Chapters 12-15 Analysis": "The intimacy of Darcy’s letter enables us to understand not just Darcy’s motivations but also his vulnerabilities and beliefs. For Elizabeth, the letter serves as a catalyst toward self-awareness. She sees her own vulnerabilities for the very first time, ultimately leading her to state that “[t]ill this moment, I never knew myself” (196).In the opening of his letter, Darcy states that he wouldn’t prevail on her to read his letter—or on himself to write it—except that his “character require[s] it” (185). However, he does not intend to propose to her again, thinking the previous day’s scene best forgotten entirely. Unlike Mr. Collins, who refuses to accept Elizabeth’s rejection, Darcy does so immediately; his only concern is clearing his name. His letter is, at times, tinged with pain, showing signs that behind Darcy’s reservation lay deep feelings. For example, he suggests he’s aware that Mr. Wickham has been “violent in his abuse of me to others” (190). Similarly, with strong language and emphasis, he writes that if Elizabeth’s “abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless” (191), she can hear confirmation of his story from Colonel Fitzwilliam.Darcy demonstrates rationality and keen perception by “attentively” (186) watching Jane and Bingley’s behavior, coming to a conclusion of what he believes to be “impartial conviction” (187). There is humility in his acknowledgment that he “must have been in error” in regards to Jane’s feelings, deferring to Elizabeth’s “superior knowledge” (186). He apologizes for causing Elizabeth pain—for example, when describing her family’s “want of propriety” (187) and when disillusioning her about Wickham—and excuses her for being unaware of Wickham’s true nature, stating that “[d]etection could not be in your power” (191). He demonstrates honesty and maturity in expressing regret for keeping from Bingley the knowledge that Jane was in London but holding “it was done for the best” (188). As he does at the Netherfield ball, Darcy also exercises restraint by not insulting Wickham the way Wickham insults him; he relates the events, but no more. Notably absent from his letter is apology for, or even mention of, his haughtiness at the Meryton ball—shown when he tells Bingley, within earshot of Elizabeth, that she is “not handsome enough to tempt me” (13).Elizabeth begins her reading of the letter “[w]ith a strong prejudice against every thing he might say” (192) and ends her rumination seeing the flaws in her opinions. She realizes “she had never felt a wish of enquiring” about Wickham’s “real character,” trusting that his attractive “countenance, voice, and manner” said enough about him, despite her never seeing in him any “trait of integrity or benevolence” (194).The language Austen employs to describe Elizabeth’s deliberation is that of reason and careful measurement: she “examine[s] the meaning of every sentence,” “weigh[s] every circumstance,” and “deliberate[s] on the probability of each statement” (193), putting down and picking up the letter until “[e]very lingering struggle in [Wickham’s] favour [sic][grows] fainter” (195). Though she tries to defend Wickham, the facts speak plainly in favor of Darcy, and in parsing out his letter, she comes to realizations about herself, feeling that the “discovery” of her prejudice and hypocrisy is “humiliating” but “just” (196). Her willingness to undergo this painful transformation—to feel “ashamed of herself” (196) and to acknowledge her flaws—redeems her: in owning her lack of the “discernment” (196) on which she prides herself, she in fact demonstrates that very discernment.", "Volume 2, Chapter 16 Summary": "When Elizabeth, Jane, and Maria reach the inn where Mr. Bennet’s coach is meeting them, Lydia and Kitty are there. Lydia has ordered a table of food and says she wants to treat them, but they have to lend her the money because she spent hers on a hat across the street. The hat is ugly, she says, but “I thought I might as well buy it as not” (205). She adds that it won’t matter what they look like now that the soldiers are leaving Meryton; Elizabeth expresses surprise at this news. Lydia says they are going to Brighton and that she wants her father to take them all. Their mother is in favor of the idea.As they sit down to lunch, Lydia informs them that “Wickham is safe” from Mary King, “a nasty little freckled thing,” for she is going to stay with her uncle in Liverpool (206). Elizabeth thinks Mary King is now safe from Wickham and wonders at the fact that she used to be interested in him.Lydia monopolizes the conversation on the ride home. She asks what Jane and Elizabeth did while they were away and launches into a long speech about how she hopes they met “pleasant men.” She calls Jane an “old maid” for being almost 23 and unmarried, and says she herself would be “ashamed” (207).The Lucases come to Longbourn to meet Maria. They sit around the table, Lydia telling them of the adventures they had that morning. Later, Lydia wants to walk to Meryton, but Elizabeth does not want people to say that “the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers” (209). Elizabeth is happy the soldiers are leaving soon. Her parents frequently discuss the possibility of a trip to Brighton.", "Volume 2, Chapter 17 Summary": "Elizabeth confides in Jane about Darcy’s proposal but leaves out the parts about Bingley’s feelings. Jane feels that “admiration of Elizabeth” (209-10) is “perfectly natural” (210). Jane regrets that Darcy’s presentation was poorly-suited to inspiring Elizabeth to accept, and though she acknowledges that he shouldn’t have assumed he’d be accepted, she also is sorry for his pain.When Elizabeth tells her about what she learned of Wickham, Jane is stunned, as she “would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much sickness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual” (210). She tries to “clear one, without involving the other” (210), but Elizabeth tells her she’ll never “be able to make both of them good for any thing” (210) and that she “must be satisfied with only one” (210). She adds that she feels sorry for Darcy but that Jane feels sorry enough for them both.Jane expresses shock that Wickham has “such an openness and gentleness in his manner” (211). Elizabeth says one man “has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it” (211). Jane never thought Darcy was “so deficient in appearance” (211); Elizabeth says she thought she was “uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him” because “to have a dislike of that kind” is “such an opening for wit” (211). They discuss whether Elizabeth should reveal to the town what Wickham has done and determine that she should not: Elizabeth says Darcy hasn’t authorized it and that Wickham will soon be gone, and Jane says he’s probably sorry for it anyway.In the days that follow, Elizabeth sees that Jane still pines for Bingley. Mrs. Bennet “shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill,” and her “comfort is” that “Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done” (213). Mrs. Bennet sneers that the Collinses will never hurt for money, that they surely talk about having Longbourn, and that she herself would be “ashamed” to have an estate “that was only entailed on me” (214).", "Volume 2, Chapter 18 Summary": "The last week of the soldiers’ stay in Meryton, Lydia and Kitty are distraught. Mrs. Bennet sympathizes, for she experienced a similar disappointment when she was a girl. They complain constantly, and Elizabeth “[feels] anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s objections” (215).Colonel and Mrs. Forster, the militia regiment leader and his wife, invite Lydia to go with them to Brighton. Ecstatic, she flaunts her invitation regardless of Kitty’s feelings. Elizabeth feels it will be the “death-warrant of all possibility of common sense” (216) for Lydia and begs her father to forbid it. She reminds him of Lydia’s “improprieties” and says she will be “yet more imprudent” in Brighton (216). Mr. Bennet responds that Lydia won’t cease her behavior until she’s embarrassed herself and that “we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances” (216). Elizabeth warns that if he doesn’t stop Lydia now, “she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment” (216). She adds that Kitty is easily influenced by Lydia. Mr. Bennet fears there will be “no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton” (217). He assures her that Colonel Forster will prevent Lydia from getting into trouble and that she is too poor “to be an object of prey to any body” (217).Meanwhile, Lydia sees herself as “the object of attention to tens and to scores” (217) of officers, “flirting with at least six officers at once” (218).Wickham has begun paying Elizabeth attention again; Elizabeth resents being “the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry” (218). On his last day in Meryton, he asks her about her time away, and she mentions she’s seen Darcy, who “improves on acquaintance” (219). Flustered, Wickham asks if Darcy has “improved in essentials” (219). Elizabeth responds that “[i]n essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was” (219). She clarifies that she means not that he himself has improved “but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood” (219). Wickham says he’s glad Darcy is now able to appear amiable and that he hopes pride will prevent Darcy from hurting others the way he’s hurt him. Their interactions are tense until they finally part.Lydia stays with the Forsters so she can go to Brighton with them the next day. Mrs. Bennet tells her to have a good time, “advice which there [is] every reason to believe [will] be attended to” (220).", "Volume 2, Chapter 19 Summary": "Mr. Bennet, “captivated by youth and beauty […] had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affect for her” (221). However, he acknowledges that this “disappointment” had been “brought on” by “his own imprudence” and takes comfort in his books, and also in finding “amusement” in “her ignorance and folly” (221). Though not ideal, he “derive[s] benefit” from the situation where he can (221). Elizabeth has always seen her father’s weaknesses but dismissed them because he’s so kind to her. However, she now notices “the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage” (221).Mrs. Bennet and Kitty constantly complain of boredom. Lydia does not write often, and her short letters focus on visits to the officers and her new parasols or gowns. Soon, Kitty can “enter Meryton without tears” (223), making Elizabeth hope that she’ll be “tolerably reasonable” (223) by Christmas. She looks forward to her upcoming trip to the Lakes with the Gardiners.Shortly before she is to leave for the tour, Elizabeth learns Mr. Gardiner needs to postpone the trip a couple of weeks and has to be back sooner than expected; therefore, they won’t have time to go all the way to the Lakes. Instead, they settle on Derbyshire, where Mrs. Gardiner has personal attachments. Elizabeth is disappointed, but as it is “her temper to be happy” (224), she accepts the change of plans. She thinks of how Pemberley is in Derbyshire and hopes she won’t run into Darcy.Finally they depart for their trip. Elizabeth and the Gardiners sincerely enjoy one another’s company. They stay in Lambton, where Mrs. Gardiner has acquaintances. Pemberley is merely five miles away; Mrs. Gardiner asks if Elizabeth would like to see the place she’s heard so much about. Elizabeth, terrified of meeting Darcy, tries to decline; she considers confessing the truth but decides against it. She tactfully asks a chambermaid if the family is at Pemberley; at hearing they are not, Elizabeth is “at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself” (225).", "Volume 2, Chapters 16-19 Analysis": "The seriousness of Elizabeth’s time at Hunsford is contrasted with the frivolousness she witnesses back home. Lydia, within minutes of seeing Jane and Elizabeth, embarks on a long discourse on the officers and on her new hat. Her petty fixations seem even more tedious compared with Elizabeth’s letter from Darcy and the grave decisions she’s recently been forced to make. Even more frustrating is that Lydia is proud of her behavior, shamelessly regaling her family with tales of their puerile games and begging her father to take them to Brighton. She is selfish and insensitive in flaunting her invitation to Brighton in front of Kitty, and once she’s there, her letters show her to be as vacuous as she was at home.In these chapters, a deeper, more nuanced vision of Mr. Bennet appears, in which his humor and sarcasm, while at first endearing, reflect a failure to protect his family. Though at first blinded by his wife’s youthful beauty, Mr. Bennet soon understood her “ignorance and folly” and took what “amusement” he could from her (221). He also retreats into books and into his library to escape from “folly and conceit” (69). He prioritizes peace above all else, failing to step in when his family needs his guidance. Mr. Bennet ignores Elizabeth’s warnings that Lydia’s going to Brighton will solidify her as “the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous” and tells her they will “have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton” (217) and that if she is going to embarrass herself, she might as well do it far from the family. He turns a blind eye to his wife’s and daughters’ behavior, ignoring the dangers right in front of him. Indeed, immediately following his show of unconcern, Lydia imagines “the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers” and that she will be “the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown” (217). All of the slowly-building events leading up to this point—Lydia’s unchecked behavior, Mrs. Bennet’s indulgence, Mr. Bennet’s consistent laxity, and Darcy’s comments—begin to intertwine and will come to a head before the novel’s end.Meanwhile, Elizabeth meets Wickham in a very different state of mind than she has before. Notably, she teases him about Darcy the way she has teased Darcy about Wickham. At the Netherfield ball, she prods Darcy without a direct accusation, mentioning they’d made “a new acquaintance” (89) and nonchalantly questioning him about prejudice. Similarly, she calmly informs Wickham that she saw Darcy at Rosings and that he “improves on acquaintance” (219). When Wickham says he hopes Darcy has “improved in essentials” (219), Elizabeth responds that when it comes to essentials, “he is very much what he ever was” (219)—a subtle statement full of double meaning that does not escape Wickham. By hinting to Wickham that Darcy is the same in character as he always was—that is, honest and full of integrity, not malicious as Wickham has suggested—Elizabeth ensures that Wickham knows she’s aware of the truth and perhaps warns him to refrain from lying about Darcy again. Wickham’s awkwardness with her for the rest of the evening shows that her words have found their mark.", "Volume 3, Chapter 1 Summary": "Pemberley is a handsome stone house surrounded by natural beauty with “no artificial appearance” (229), and Elizabeth is impressed. The housekeeper, Mrs. Reynolds, gives them a tour. The rooms are elegant, not “gaudy nor uselessly fine” (229) like Rosings’s rooms. Elizabeth considers that she could have been mistress there; she finds consolation in the thought that she wouldn’t be allowed to invite the Gardiners.Mrs. Reynolds speaks highly of Darcy, saying she “has never had a cross word from him in my life” and that he is the best master, is generous with the poor, and was “the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world” (232). She also describes Darcy’s generosity toward his sister. Elizabeth ponders the significance of his servants’ praise. With “many people’s happiness […] in his guardianship,” it is “in his power to bestow” much “pleasure or pain” (234).As they walk the grounds, they encounter Darcy. Elizabeth and Darcy blush and engage in awkward conversation. The Gardiners admire him; Elizabeth is “overpowered by shame and vexation” (235). She wonders at his ability to speak civilly to her and to ask after her family; she has never seen “such gentleness” in him. She wonders what he thinks of her, “whether, in defiance of every thing, she [is] still dear to him” (236).Darcy asks “if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends” (238). When she tells him they’re family, she expects him not to talk with them anymore; however, he walks with them and strikes up a conversation with Mr. Gardiner. She’s pleased that Darcy “should know she had she relations for whom there [is] no need to blush” (238). When Darcy learns her uncle loves to fish, he invites him to fish at Pemberley. She asks herself why he has changed, thinking he couldn’t possibly still love her. Darcy says the Bingleys and his sister will join him the next day; his sister wants to meet Elizabeth, and he asks if he may introduce them. Elizabeth feels this is “a compliment of the highest kind” (240).They reach the carriage and decline Darcy’s invitation to go inside the house. After driving off, the Gardiners ask Elizabeth why she’d told them he was “so disagreeable.” Elizabeth tells them “she [has] never seen him so pleasant as this morning” (241). Mrs. Gardiner says it’s hard to believe he treated Wickham so poorly. Elizabeth suggests the situation isn’t what it seemed and that Darcy’s “character [is] by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable” (241).", "Volume 3, Chapter 2 Summary": "When Darcy brings his sister to the inn to meet Elizabeth, the Gardiners believe he must be in love with her. Elizabeth is “quite amazed at her own discomposure” (243). She worries that Darcy had “said too much in her favour [sic]” (243) and that she will not impress Miss Darcy.Elizabeth is surprised to find that Miss Darcy is not proud but shy. She finds “good-humour [sic] in her face” (243) and gentleness in her behavior. Bingley arrives, and Elizabeth can’t be angry in the face of his “unaffected cordiality.” Elizabeth is worried about pleasing her guests, but all three are “prepossessed in her favour [sic]” (244): “Bingley [is] ready, Georgiana [is] eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased” (244).Elizabeth sees nothing in Bingley and Miss Darcy’s interactions to suggest they’re in love with each other. She senses him leading the conversation around to Jane and hears tenderness in his voice as he asks about her. On the rare occasion Elizabeth glances at Darcy, she finds him looking content; she also notices that his tone, like the day before, is gentle. She’s impressed with his desire to please “the very relations whom he had openly disdained” (245); she has never “seen him […] so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours [sic]” (245).Before leaving, Darcy invites the Gardiners and Elizabeth to dinner at Pemberley. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner like Darcy; they also think less of Wickham, having heard from townspeople that he’d left with many debts, which Darcy had settled.Elizabeth lies in bed, deciphering her softening feelings for Darcy. She is “ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him” and feels “gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him” (247). Though she’d expected him to avoid her, he seems “eager to preserve the acquaintance” (248). She appreciates his kindness toward her aunt and uncle and acknowledges the “change in a man of so much pride” (248). She has “interest in his welfare” and tries to determine “how far she [wishes] that welfare to depend upon herself” (248).Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth decide to visit Miss Darcy at Pemberley the next morning, while Mr. Gardiner and Darcy fish.", "Volume 3, Chapter 3 Summary": "Elizabeth wonders how she will be received by Miss Bingley, whose “dislike of her,” (249) she is convinced, “had originated in jealousy” (249). Miss Darcy receives Elizabeth and Mrs. Gardiner with “shyness and fear of doing wrong” (249). Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley greet them coolly. Though Bingley’s sisters sit silently, Elizabeth, Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Darcy’s attendant, Mrs. Annesley, engage in conversation. Miss Darcy appears to want to participate and does so as quietly as possible. Elizabeth notices Miss Bingley is watching her and both “[wishes]” and “[fears]” (250) Darcy will enter the room soon. When Darcy and the other men return from fishing, Miss Darcy is more likely to talk.Miss Bingley, who’s been watching Darcy make efforts to ensure Elizabeth and Miss Darcy get to know each other, asks Elizabeth if the officers have left Meryton, noting that their leaving “must be a great loss to your family” (251). Elizabeth is startled but answers casually, then notices Darcy blushing and watching her. Miss Darcy won’t look up. Elizabeth believes that if Miss Bingley had known Miss Darcy’s history with Wickham, she wouldn’t have asked this question, which was meant to hurt only Elizabeth.While Darcy walks the party out to their carriage, Miss Bingley criticizes Elizabeth to Miss Darcy, who thinks Elizabeth anything is “lovely and amiable” because “[h]er brother’s recommendation [is] enough to insure her favour [sic]” (252). When Darcy returns, Miss Bingley remarks that she “never could see any beauty” (252) in Elizabeth. Even her eyes, “which have sometimes been called so fine” (253), have nothing “extraordinary in them” (253); she also has “a self-sufficiency […] which is intolerable” (253). When Miss Bingley reminds Darcy that he once believed Elizabeth to be pretty, Darcy, fed up, responds that his feelings have since changed: he now thinks she is “one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance” (253).In the carriage ride home, Elizabeth and Mrs. Gardiner discuss everything but Darcy, the topic that “particularly interest[s] them both” (253).", "Volume 3, Chapters 1-3 Analysis": "When Elizabeth visits Pemberley, what she finds is the opposite of what she expects. Darcy’s house is a “handsome” stone house atop “a considerable eminence” (229). It sits among “high woody hills” by a beautiful stream “without any artificial appearance” (229). While the rooms are “lofty and handsome,” they are “neither gaudy nor uselessly fine” (230). These descriptions easily fit Darcy himself. Handsome and stately, he commands respect but is not ostentatious. Just as his home possesses “natural beauty” (229), he says what he means and appreciates Elizabeth’s straightforwardness, as well. The “real elegance” (230) of Darcy’s home contrasts the showy decorations of Rosings—an apt contrast, as Lady Catherine condones the servile flattery of Sir William and Mr. Collins. When Elizabeth thinks of how she “might have been mistress” (230) of Pemberley, she is symbolically expressing regret for losing Darcy himself.Meeting people who know Darcy intimately is a sobering reminder of the dangers of secondhand knowledge. Elizabeth hears glowing reports from Mrs. Reynolds, who claims that Darcy is “the best master” (233) that she has “never had a cross word from him” (232), and that all of the servants would say the same. Elizabeth asks herself, “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” (232) and is “impatient for more” (232-33). Later, the Gardiners speak with townspeople, who confirm that Wickham is not much liked and that Darcy has settled his debts. Similarly, Elizabeth, having believed Wickham’s account of her, assumed Miss Darcy would be disagreeable and proud; however, when meeting her in person, she finds that she is merely painfully shy, unable to utter barely a word.These chapters show Darcy and Elizabeth both demonstrating willingness to learn and eagerness to grow. Elizabeth finds Darcy’s manner upon meeting them at Pemberley “strikingly altered” (236); he speaks with tenderness and even asks about the very family he’d disdained in his proposal. She is delighted when Darcy invites her uncle to fish at Pemberley. When he and Miss Darcy visit her at Lambton, she notices a lack of “hauteur” and “disdain”; he seeks “the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace” and speaks with a manner “free from self-consequence or unbending reserve” (245). His change of manner demonstrates that he has taken her criticisms seriously and made an effort to remedy them. He demonstrates newfound humility and tolerance.Elizabeth can appreciate these qualities because she herself possesses them. Elizabeth, as she demonstrated in her response to Darcy’s letter, is not above assessing new information, changing her mind, and acknowledging her own missteps. She feels “shame and vexation” upon meeting Darcy at Pemberley, worrying that her touring his house after their argument casts her in “a disgraceful light” (235). Hosting him at the inn at Lambton, she is surprised to find that for the first time, she is nervous around him; with the dynamic between them new and unknown, she is “anxious to please” (243) and “to make herself agreeable to all” (244). Elizabeth, having recognized the magnitude of her misunderstanding, has been humbled. That so many characters—Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, Wickham—lack this self-objectivity makes it all the more remarkable and admirable.", "Volume 3, Chapter 4 Summary": "On the third morning, Elizabeth receives two letters from Jane. In the first, Jane writes that an urgent message arrived from Colonel Forster informing them that Lydia and Wickham ran off together to Scotland, where many young English people eloped in order to escape the stricter marriage laws of England. Jane hopes for the best, writing that Wickham must not be after money because Lydia’s family isn’t wealthy.The second letter reveals that they now believe Lydia and Wickham did not go to Scotland. Colonel Forster has traced them to London. Jane writes that as unfortunate a marriage as it would be, they “are now anxious to be assured it has taken place” (255), for the shame of the couple living together out of wedlock would be worse. Jane thinks Lydia and Wickham might still be married, but Colonel Forster warns Wickham “[is] not a man to be trusted” (256). Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are devastated and angry with Kitty for hiding Lydia and Wickham’s plans. Jane asks Elizabeth and the Gardiners to return to Longbourn. Mr. Bennet, she writes, is going to London.Just as Elizabeth finishes reading, Darcy arrives. Unable to hide her distress, she tells him she must find Mr. Gardiner immediately; Darcy sends his servant instead. He asks her “in a tone of gentleness and commiseration” (257) if he can bring her a glass of wine.In tears, Elizabeth tells Darcy that Lydia has eloped with Wickham and that he “know[s] him too well to doubt the rest” (258). Darcy, astonished, paces up and down the room in thought. Elizabeth assumes he is thinking about this “proof of family weakness” (258), and her belief that he can no longer love her reveals to her how truly she loves him.Darcy, with “compassion,” says he wishes there were something he could do, regrets that he and his sister won’t see her at Pemberley, and “with only one serious, parting look” (259), takes his leave. Elizabeth laments that they won’t meet again with such “cordiality” (259) as they had the last few days. She has no hope that Wickham will marry Lydia, nor does she have faith in Lydia’s “virtue” or “understanding” (260).The Gardiners return and, though “Lydia [has] never been a favourite [sic] with them,” realize that “all [are] concerned in it” (261). Mr. Gardiner promises to help however he can, and the three depart for Longbourn.", "Volume 3, Chapter 5 Summary": "In the carriage, Elizabeth and the Gardiners discuss the situation. The Gardiners have hope that Lydia and Wickham are married, but Elizabeth fears the worst, believing Wickham would never marry a woman from whom he couldn’t benefit financially. She also believes Wickham must see that Lydia has no brothers to defend her and a father who has given “little attention” (263) to her behavior. When Mrs. Gardiner asks if Elizabeth really thinks Wickham is capable of such travesty, Elizabeth replies that she knows he is but can’t relate the whole story. She blames herself for not warning Lydia about Wickham, though she notes that neither Wickham nor Lydia had ever demonstrated a particular preference for the other.At Longbourn, Mrs. Bennet complains about “her own sufferings” and blames “every body but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing” (267). She blames Mr. Bennet for not letting them all go to Brighton, Wickham for his “villainous conduct” (267), the Forsters for not keeping a close eye on Lydia, and the Collinses, preemptively, for evicting them from Longbourn when Mr. Bennet is killed in a duel with Wickham.Mr. Gardiner assures Mrs. Bennet that he will join Mr. Bennet in London to help. She thanks him and instructs him to tell Lydia not to worry about her wedding clothes, that she can have as much money for clothes as she’d like after she is married.Jane shows Elizabeth the letter Lydia left Mrs. Forster. Lydia writes that she’s run off to Gretna Green—the Scottish town closest to the English border, therefore popular with elopers—to marry Wickham and that it will be “a good joke” (277) when she surprises her family with her marriage. Though Elizabeth is infuriated by the levity of the letter, she is relieved that at least Lydia had intended to be married.Jane tells Elizabeth that Mrs. Philips came to help; also, Lady Lucas visited and offered the help of herself and her daughters. Elizabeth says that at times like this, “one cannot see too little of one’s neighbors,” who should “triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied” (272).", "Volume 3, Chapter 6 Summary": "Mrs. Gardiner stays at Longbourn while Mr. Gardiner is in London. People in Meryton “[seem] striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light” (273). He’s left behind many debts and is now considered “the wickedest young man in the world” (273). They also claim to always have “distrusted the appearance of his goodness” (273). From London, Mr. Gardiner writes that Colonel Forster has been generous and kind in his help. Every day the family awaits the mail, anxious for news.A letter arrives from Mr. Collins sending sympathy for “the grievous affliction […] which no time can remove” (275). He writes that Lydia’s death “would have been a blessing in comparison of this” (275). Charlotte believes Lydia’s irresponsibility “has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence” (275), but he thinks “her own disposition must be naturally bad” (275). Lady Catherine agrees with Mr. Collins that Lydia’s behavior will impact the lives of all her sisters, for who “will connect themselves with such a family?” (276). He notes how narrowly he missed being “involved in all your sorrow and disgrace” and concludes by suggesting they “throw off” Lydia “for ever” (276).Mr. Gardiner writes that it appears Wickham has no living relations and large gaming debts. Mr. Bennet is to come home shortly; Mrs. Bennet wonders who is going “to fight Wickham, and make him marry her” (277). Mrs. Gardiner meets Mr. Gardiner in London, still considering Elizabeth’s relationship with Darcy. Elizabeth feels that “had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat better” (277).Upon his return, Elizabeth tells Mr. Bennet she’s sorry for what he’s suffered. He says he deserves to suffer because “[i]t has been my own doing” (278). When Elizabeth objects, he tells her to “let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame” (278).Mr. Bennet makes an offhand joke about Kitty running away; she denies she would, saying if she ever goes to Brighton, she will “behave better than Lydia” (279). Mr. Bennet says not only will she never go to Brighton but he will prohibit all balls, and she can’t leave the house unless she spends “ten minutes of every day in a rational manner” (279). When Kitty cries, Mr. Bennet says that if she behaves for ten years, he’ll reconsider.", "Volume 3, Chapter 7 Summary": "Mr. Gardiner writes that he has located Lydia and Wickham and has seen them both. They aren’t married yet, but he believes they will marry soon, as long as Mr. Bennet agrees to settle upon Lydia her share of the 5,000 pounds to be split by the Bennet daughters after his death, in addition to 100 pounds a year. He adds that after Wickham’s debts are paid, money will still be left over for him and Lydia. Mr. Gardiner has taken the liberty of agreeing to these terms on Mr. Bennet’s behalf and awaits only his answer before seeing Lydia and Wickham marry.Jane and Elizabeth are ecstatic. Mr. Bennet wonders how much money Mr. Gardiner paid Wickham to ensure the marriage, believing Wickham surely isn’t only receiving the money specified in the terms. Elizabeth agrees Mr. Gardiner must have paid Wickham’s debts and worries “he has distressed himself”(282) with such a large financial investment. Mr. Bennet says “Wickham’s a fool” to marry Lydia for less than £10,000 and that he “should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship” (282).Jane holds that Wickham must love Lydia if he’s marrying her, and that it’s impossible that Mr. Gardiner has been able to contribute so much money to the cause. Elizabeth says Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner have been so kind to help Lydia and that “[i]f such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy” (283).Jane and Elizabeth share the news with Mrs. Bennet, who is all excitement. She spends no time remembering how irresponsibly Lydia has behaved; she is delighted that Lydia will be married at sixteen and relieved that her brother has taken care of everything. Her first concern is how much money Mr. Bennet will give Lydia for new clothes.Jane attempts to remind Mrs. Bennet of Mr. Gardiner’s sacrifices. Mrs. Bennet says Mr. Gardiner is Lydia’s uncle and that he should have done it. She goes to Lady Lucas’s to share the good news. Elizabeth, “sick of this folly” (285), goes to her room. She tries to be thankful that the crisis has ended as well as it could.", "Volume 3, Chapter 8 Summary": "Saving money had not seemed urgent early in the Bennets’ marriage, when they assumed they would have a son who would cut off the entail and secure the daughters’ financial futures. Mr. Bennet regrets not having saved money, for had he done so, “Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle” (286). He vows to repay Mr. Gardiner as soon as possible. He agrees to the terms Mr. Gardiner put forth and is glad to have to exert so little effort, for after the anger passes, “he naturally return[s] to all his former indolence” (287).The news spreads. People regret that Lydia’s marrying Wickham makes for more boring conversation than her becoming a prostitute or being ostracized. However, people take comfort in the fact that “with such a husband her misery [is] considered certain” (287).Mrs. Bennet, feeling no shame, is “in spirits oppressively high” (288). In her search for a house for Lydia, she “reject[s] many as deficient in size and importance” (288). Mr. Bennet tells her he will never receive Lydia and Wickham as visitors at Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is horrified that Mr. Bennet won’t send Lydia money for clothes, wondering how he can “refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid” (288).Elizabeth wishes she hadn’t told Darcy about the elopement. She believes “a gulf impassable [exists] between them” (289), for he would never marry into a family connected with Wickham. Feeling more than ever that she could have loved him, she realizes that “in disposition and talents” (289) he is actually perfect for her, that their marriage “must have been to the advantage of both” (290). She has no hope for Lydia and Wickham’s happiness, for they were “only brought together because their passions [are] stronger than their virtue” (290).Mr. Gardiner writes to Mr. Bennet that, on his advice, Wickham is joining the army. Colonel Forster is letting Wickham’s creditors near Brighton know that they will soon be paid and asks that Mr. Bennet do the same for creditors in Meryton. The family is happy for the news—all except Mrs. Bennet, who laments that Lydia has to move away.Lydia wants to visit before they depart for the north. Mr. Bennet at first refuses to let them, but Jane and Elizabeth convince him to receive them.", "Volume 3, Chapter 9 Summary": "Lydia and Wickham are married, and they visit Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is thrilled, while Mr. Bennet scarcely speaks. Elizabeth and even Jane are “disgusted” and “shocked” by Lydia’s “untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless” behavior as she unapologetically “turn[s] from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations” (293). Lydia eagerly wants to know if everyone in town knows she’s married; Elizabeth runs out of the room, joining the family again only when they sit down for dinner.Lydia tells Jane that she now has the right to sit at her mother’s right side, that Jane “must go lower, because I am a married woman” (294). Lydia grows bolder and bolder as the day goes on, saying she wants to meet all her friends to hear them call her “Mrs. Wickham” and to “boast of being married” (294). She says all her sisters must “envy” her for her “charming” (294) husband and that they all should have gone to Brighton so the other girls could find husbands. She says that if her sisters visit her in the north, she will be sure to find dancing partners for them. Mrs. Bennet eagerly agrees to this plan.Lydia and Wickham stay for ten days, and many parties are thrown. Elizabeth finds that Wickham, as she’d expected, does not love Lydia as much as Lydia loves him. Elizabeth is convinced that he wouldn’t have married her, that he’d intended to flee only because of “distress of circumstances” (295), and that he merely didn’t object to Lydia joining him.Despite Elizabeth’s objections, Lydia tells Elizabeth about her wedding. She had been eager for it to take place and wondered if Wickham would wear his blue coat. She relates that Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had been “horrid unpleasant” to her and that they hadn’t let her out of the house for two weeks. In giving her account of that day, she offhandedly mentions that Darcy was at the wedding. Elizabeth is stunned. Lydia says she wasn’t supposed to mention Darcy’s presence, that it was supposed to be a secret; Elizabeth doesn’t question her but, impatient to know more, runs out of the room to immediately, in order to write a letter to Mrs. Gardiner asking why Darcy had been “where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go” (297).", "Volume 3, Chapter 10 Summary": "Mrs. Gardiner writes that the day she returned from Longbourn, Darcy visited Mr. Gardiner to tell him he’d spoken with Lydia and Wickham. His motive, he said, was that he blamed himself for the fact that Wickham’s true character wasn’t known and felt it was “his duty to step forward” (299). Mrs. Gardiner suggests he perhaps had another motive.Darcy learned Lydia and Wickham’s location from Mrs. Younge, who was in charge of Miss Darcy when she eloped with Wickham. He tried to convince Lydia to return home, but Lydia refused. Darcy realized the next best option was to ensure the marriage. Wickham told Darcy he’d been forced to leave because of “debts of honour which were very pressing” and, at the very least, “scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone” (300). He admitted he hadn’t married Lydia because he hoped to marry a wealthier woman. However, Wickham ended up succumbing to “the temptation of immediately relief” (300). Darcy and Wickham met several times to talk about the terms of Wickham’s marrying Lydia. Once this was accomplished, Darcy spoke with Mr. Gardiner about the plan.Mrs. Gardiner writes that Darcy did everything himself but required that Mr. Gardiner take the credit, “which went sorely against the grain” (301). Mr. Gardiner was glad for Elizabeth’s letter, which required him to relinquish “his borrowed feathers” (301).After the wedding, Mrs. Gardiner lectured Lydia on her distressing behavior, to no avail. At the end of her letter, Mrs. Gardiner tells Elizabeth how much she likes Darcy, how he lacks only “liveliness,” which “his wife may teach him” if he marries “prudently” (302). She adds that she would like to explore more of Pemberley.Elizabeth is overcome by Darcy’s “exertion of goodness” (303). She thinks about the “trouble and mortification” he endured to “bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid” and dares to hope he did it for her (303). Her family owes “every thing to him” (303), and she regrets every “ungracious sensation she had every encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him” (304).Wickham approaches. He says they were always friends, and she agrees. They discuss her time visiting Pemberley, and Elizabeth subtly reveals she knows the truth of his story. She tells him that as they are now brother and sister, they shouldn’t quarrel, and he kisses her hand.", "Volume 3, Chapters 4-10 Analysis": "The happy resolution at the end of Chapter 3 explodes into a final burst of suspense in Chapter 4. The chapters that follow offer the final push for Darcy to show his integrity and heroism. They also offer opportunities for other important characters to show their true colors.When Elizabeth is at Pemberley, she longingly wonders what it would have been like to be mistress and consoles herself by thinking she wouldn’t be allowed the pleasure of inviting Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. Similarly, when she introduces the Gardiners to Darcy, she expects Darcy to run “as fast as he [can] from such disgraceful companions” (238). When Elizabeth reveals to Darcy that Lydia has eloped with Wickham, he paces the floor; she assumes he can no longer love her when her family is in “the deepest disgrace” (258). She is wrong, however, on all counts. Darcy is warm and engaging with the Gardiners and not only invites Mr. Gardiner to fish at Pemberley but also visits him in London to discuss Lydia and Wickham. When Darcy paces the floor upon hearing of the elopement, he is likely thinking of how he can help, for he leaves to track them the very next day. Finally, Darcy’s love for Elizabeth does withstand the scandal and the resulting connection with Wickham. When Elizabeth learns of Darcy’s role in the marriage of Wickham and Lydia, she understands, finally, his “goodness,” and she senses that despite the obstacles, “he had done it for her” (303).Just as Darcy solidifies his integrity, Lydia and Mrs. Bennet solidify their incorrigibility. Mrs. Bennet expresses nothing but delight at Lydia’s marriage, calling Wickham “dear Wickham” and exclaiming that they will have a “merry” (284) time when they meet. She fixates on procuring Lydia new clothes, showing a lack of appreciation for the sacrifices they believe Mr. Gardiner to have made. In fact, when Mr. Bennet refuses to send money for Lydia’s clothes, Mrs. Bennet is “more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place” (288). Like Mrs. Bennet, Lydia feels no shame over the effects her behavior has had on her family. Failing to see the seriousness, she treats the situation like a game. Her letter to Mrs. Forster speaks of “[w]hat a good joke” her elopement is and how she “can hardly write for laughing” (271). When she returns to Longbourn, she acts superior to Jane and Elizabeth. Even her account of the wedding to Elizabeth demonstrates her thoughtlessness and naiveté: she complains that the Gardiners were rude to her and doesn’t understand why they wouldn’t let her leave the house.Mr. Bennet tells Elizabeth he deserves to suffer because Lydia’s elopement is his fault; however, it isn’t long before he “return[s] to all his former indolence” (287). Lydia herself, who believes Wickham is “an angel” she should “never be happy without” (271), is too naive to see that his love for her is “not equal to” (295) her love for him. Darcy shows humility in paying Wickham’s debts anonymously, though glimpses of his honor have been shown in Mrs. Reynolds’ reports of his generosity to the poor. As for Elizabeth, she finally sees that “he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her” (289).", "Volume 3, Chapter 11 Summary": "Mrs. Bennet is sad to lose Lydia and tells her to write; Lydia says “married women have never much time for writing” (306-07) but that her sisters can write to her because “[t]hey will have nothing else to do” (307). Wickham is charming as ever upon leaving. Mr. Bennet, snidely noting his flattering manner, says he is “prodigiously proud of him” and that even Sir William can’t “produce a more valuable son-in-law” (307).News that Bingley is to return to Netherfield brightens Mrs. Bennet’s “spiritless condition” (307). Jane claims to have no interest in him and that he’s welcome at Netherfield if he wants to go. She assures Elizabeth that she only feels self-conscious because she knows people are thinking of her, but Elizabeth doesn’t believe her. Elizabeth feels Bingley has come down alone because he still loves Jane and that Darcy has given his blessing.Mrs. Bennet once again asks her husband to visit Bingley. Mr. Bennet says he will not, that last time she asked him to visit Bingley he’d been promised he would marry one of his daughters. He says Bingley can visit if he wants to, that “[h]e knows where we live” (309).Bingley and Darcy visit Longbourn. As they approach the house, Mrs. Bennet says she “hate[s] the very sight” (310) of Darcy. Jane feels sympathy for Elizabeth, but she still doesn’t know that Darcy is that man to whom “the whole family [are] indebted” (310) and that Elizabeth is falling in love with him. Elizabeth cautiously hopes that Darcy’s feelings for her have not changed and is embarrassed when Mrs. Bennet receives Bingley too warmly and Darcy too coldly.Darcy does not speak frequently as he did when he was visiting Elizabeth and the Gardiners, and Elizabeth is disappointed. Mrs. Bennet tells Bingley that he must have seen Lydia’s marriage in the papers; Bingley says he did and congratulates her. Mrs. Bennet makes a remark about Wickham not having as many friends as he’d like; mortified, Elizabeth changes the subject. Mrs. Bennet continues to embarrass herself and her daughters with her “officious attention” (313). However, when Elizabeth sees how Bingley clearly is still so enamored of Jane, she is heartened.", "Volume 3, Chapter 12 Summary": "Elizabeth can’t understand why Darcy visited if he was going to “be silent, grave, and indifferent” (314). She vows not to think about him again. Jane tries to convince her that she and Bingley are “indifferent” (315) to each other, making Elizabeth laugh.Bingley and Darcy return a few days later for a dinner party at Longbourn. Elizabeth is dismayed when Darcy is seated far away from her at the table, but close to her mother, whose “ungraciousness [makes] the sense of what they [owe] him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind” (316). In the drawing room, circumstances prevent them from being near each other; the one time they are, they engage in brief, awkward conversation before separating again. They are placed at different tables at cards, and then Bingley and Darcy depart.Mrs. Bennet is delighted by the success of the evening and is sure Jane will marry Bingley after all. Jane continues to insist she sees Bingley only “as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it” (318). She begs Elizabeth to stop smiling at her and insisting she isn’t telling the truth.", "Volume 3, Chapter 13 Summary": "Bingley visits several times, alone, as Darcy is in London. He and Mr. Bennet go shooting one morning. Mr. Bennet finds “nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence” (321) and therefore is friendlier than Bingley has ever seen him.That evening Bingley proposes to Jane, making Jane “the happiest creature in the world” (322). After requesting permission from Mr. Bennet, Bingley asks Elizabeth for her best wishes, which Elizabeth readily gives, believing they will be truly happy together because they have “excellent understanding,” “super-excellent disposition,” and “a general similarity of feeling and taste” (323).After Bingley leaves, Mr. Bennet congratulates Jane and says she will be very happy, that she is “a good girl” (323),and that he has “great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled” (323). He says she and Bingley are both “so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on,” that “every servant will cheat” (323) them, and that they are “so generous” that they “will always exceed” their income (323). Mrs. Bennet says it’s impossible for them to exceed Mr. Bingley’s large income and that she has always known Jane “could not be so beautiful for nothing” (324). Jane now becomes her “favourite [sic] child” (324).Bingley visits frequently. Jane is glad to learn he’d had no idea she was in London the previous spring and believes “[i]t must have been his sisters’ doing” (324). She says that once his sisters see he is so happy, they will “learn to be contented” (325). She tells Elizabeth that he still loved her when he went to London and stayed away only because he thought she didn’t love him. Elizabeth is happy to discover that Bingley hasn’t told Jane that Darcy was instrumental in keeping him away. Jane wants Elizabeth to be as happy as she is; Elizabeth says that “[t]ill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness” (325).News of the engagement travels quickly, and the Bennets are said to be “the luckiest family in the world,” even though only a few weeks before “they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune” (325).", "Volume 3, Chapter 14 Summary": "One day, Lady Catherine visits Longbourn, shocking everyone. Mrs. Bennet is honored, offering Lady Catherine something to eat, which Lady Catherine refuses. Lady Catherine haughtily comments that their estate is “very small” and that their sitting room looks “most inconvenient” (327). She asks Elizabeth to walk with her outside.Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth that she’s heard that Elizabeth and Darcy are to be married and that “it must be a scandalous falsehood” (328). Elizabeth replies that she doesn’t know why Lady Catherine would visit if she believed it to be a falsehood. Growing exasperated, Lady Catherine asks Elizabeth if it’s true; Elizabeth tells her that she chooses not to answer her questions.Lady Catherine “insist[s] on being satisfied” and asks if Darcy has proposed to her, to which Elizabeth responds that Lady Catherine has “declared it to be impossible” (329). Lady Catherine reminds Elizabeth who she is, that she is not “accustomed to such language as this,” and that she’s “entitled” to know Darcy’s “dearest concerns” (329). Elizabeth responds that she is not entitled to know hers and that Lady Catherine’s rudeness makes her unlikely to answer. Lady Catherine says Darcy is engaged to her daughter; Elizabeth replies that if that’s true, Lady Catherine has no reason to fear he’s proposed to her. Lady Catherine warns that if she marries Darcy, she will “be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him” (330). She is happy when Elizabeth admits that she and Darcy are not engaged but is further angered when Elizabeth refuses to promise it won’t ever happen. Elizabeth tells Lady Catherine, “You have widely mistaken my character” (331), adding that Lady Catherine has “no right to concern” (332) herself in her life.Lady Catherine says she’s aware of Lydia’s situation and that Darcy can’t be connected to her family, asking, “Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?” (332). Elizabeth tells Lady Catherine she has insulted her “in every possible method” (332) and that the conversation is over; Lady Catherine accuses her of being “[u]nfeeling” and “selfish” (332). Elizabeth promises only to make choices for her own happiness with no regard for Lady Catherine or anyone else.Back at the house, Lady Catherine rudely takes her leave. Mrs. Bennet says Lady Catherine is “a very fine-looking woman” (333) and that it was “civil” (333) of her to call. She asks Elizabeth what they talked about, and Elizabeth concocts a lie.", "Volume 3, Chapters 11-14 Analysis": "The falling action, in which the dust settles after the explosive climax, has seen new conflicts and surprises. With Lydia married and Darcy’s identity as her savior revealed, characters demonstrate the lessons they’ve learned (or haven’t learned) and offer hints as to how they will handle their new world.Despite Mrs. Bennet’s vehement requests, Mr. Bennet refuses to visit Bingley, citing the fact that she’d insisted on its necessity last time, when in fact it came to nothing. Bingley, Mr. Bennet says, “knows where we live,” and he “will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours [sic] every time they go away and come back again” (309). After tumultuous recent events, social conventions seem silly and pointless, and the necessity of visiting is now “an etiquette I despise” (309).Wary of being hurt again and of misreading Bingley’s intentions, Jane protects herself by feigning indifference. She claims not to care if Bingley is in town one way or the other: she says “that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain” (308), that they see each other “only as common and indifferent acquaintance” (315), and that she has “no wish” (318) beyond friendship. Only when Bingley proposes does she “have no reserves from Elizabeth” (322).Elizabeth, knowing what Darcy has done for her family, is even more embarrassed by her mother’s rude behavior than before. When Mrs. Bennet states that she “hate[s] the very sight” of Darcy, Elizabeth is uncomfortable, knowing Darcy is “the person to whom the whole family [are] indebted” (310). When Mrs. Bennet is “cold and ceremonious” with Darcy, Elizabeth is “hurt and distressed,” for “her mother owe[s]”to Darcy “the preservation of her favourite [sic] daughter from irremediable infamy” (311).As she does in Derbyshire after Darcy’s letter forced her to see Darcy in a new, admirable light, Elizabeth behaves toward Darcy with nervousness and reservation—as opposed to her careless ease the year before, when his true character was still unknown to her. She wishes to be near him and laments when they’re kept apart at cards; when they do speak, it’s stilted and superficial, neither knowing how to behave. This is a marked difference from their interactions at Netherfield, which are sharp, thoughtful, and intelligent, and which distinguish them not only from other characters but also as for a good match for each other. Elizabeth feels anxious for the renewal of their freely flowing conversation.Elizabeth stands firm in the face of insults to herself and her family. Unimpressed by Lady Catherine’s claims to what she wants by mere virtue of her wealth and status, Elizabeth deftly avoids answering questions, and by asking pointed questions of her own, she manages to reveal Lady Catherine’s hypocrisy—even, at one point, asking her why she worries Darcy will propose to her if he’s already engaged to Miss de Bourgh, a point that forces Lady Catherine to pause and collect herself. Elizabeth’s trademark wit, which we’ve previously seen leveled at Darcy, is used here to combat the rudeness and entitlement of Lady Catherine. Her staunchness in refusing Lady Catherine her wish—a promise that she will never marry Darcy—demonstrates not only her refusal to bow to the aristocracy but also her true feelings about Darcy.", "Volume 3, Chapter 15 Summary": "Elizabeth is fearful that Lady Catherine will come between her and Darcy by repeating to him all the concerns she has over their hypothetical marriage and that Darcy’s “notions of dignity” (334) will force him to conclude that her arguments “[contain] much good sense and solid reasoning” (335). She doesn’t know how much he depends on his aunt for guidance, but “[i]f he had been wavering before” about whether to attempt a relationship with her, Lady Catherine’s interference would “settle every doubt” and inspire him decide to “be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him” (335).The next day, Mr. Bennet asks to speak to Elizabeth privately. He tells her, expressing his shock, that Mr. Collins has written to acknowledge that it appears Elizabeth is about to be married to Darcy and that Lady Catherine disapproves of the match. Mr. Bennet also expresses irritation that Mr. Collins chastises him for having received Lydia and Wickham in his house.Mr. Bennet expects Elizabeth will be surprised by this news, telling her that Mr. Collins could not have picked a man less likely to marry Elizabeth, that if they had picked “any other man it would have been nothing” (338), but Darcy’s “perfect indifference” and Elizabeth’s “pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd” (338). He says he hates writing but enjoys having Mr. Collins as a writing partner: he gives Mr. Collins “preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law” (338).Elizabeth can barely put on a smile and laugh off what her father has said; her father’s comments about Darcy’s indifference have hurt her and have made her wonder not if he was “seeing too little” (338) but rather if “she might have fancied too much” (338).", "Volume 3, Chapter 16 Summary": "When Bingley and Darcy next call at Longbourn, Elizabeth thanks Darcy “again and again” (339) for helping Lydia; he reiterates that he didn’t want her to know because it would cause her “uneasiness” and that “the wish of giving happiness to you” (339) was most in his thoughts. He states that his feelings haven’t changed since last spring; he asks if her feelings are the same and tells her that if they are, he won’t mention it again. When Elizabeth confirms her feelings have changed, he experiences “happiness […] such as he had probably never felt before” as he tells her “of what importance she [is] to him” (340). Lady Catherine had told him about her conversation with Elizabeth and it had given him hope, for if Elizabeth had no intention of marrying him, she would have told Lady Catherine so.When Elizabeth makes a joke about her “abusing” him “so abominably,” Darcy asks, “‘What did you say of me that I did not deserve?’” (341). He believes his behavior was “unpardonable,” and he “cannot think of it without abhorrence” (341). Elizabeth says they should not “quarrel for the greater share of blame,” for they have both “improved in civility” (341). Darcy tells her that her words the day of his proposal affected him deeply; she, too, regrets what she said and says “all her former prejudices [have] been removed” (342). When Darcy expresses regret over the wording in his letter, Elizabeth says they should forget the letter because “[t]he feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then” (342).Darcy says he has “been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle” (342) and still might be had it not been for her. He has learned “a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous,” and has been “properly humbled” (343). He’d proposed expecting to be accepted, but “a woman worthy of being pleased” (343) deserves more.When they met at Pemberley, Darcy says, he wanted to demonstrate that he had taken her words to heart. He confirms that he’d given Bingley his blessing in proposing to Jane: after watching Jane during their recent visits and determining she truly did love him, he’d confessed to Bingley that he’d been mistaken about his feelings regarding Jane’s affection for him.", "Volume 3, Chapter 17 Summary": "Elizabeth is worried about her family’s reaction to her engagement. Jane at first doesn’t believe her. She begs Elizabeth to “do any thing rather than marry without affection” (346). Elizabeth tells her the complete story, including the events related to Bingley and to Darcy’s role in helping Lydia, and Jane is satisfied that Elizabeth will be happy. Elizabeth and Darcy agree that Darcy will ask for Mr. Bennet’s consent that night and that Elizabeth will talk to her mother herself: she is worried that Mrs. Bennet’s reaction will be embarrassing.After Darcy receives consent from Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth speaks with her father. He asks how she could marry a man she hates, and Elizabeth regrets having spoken so ill of Darcy. Mr. Bennet believes Elizabeth must be marrying him because he is rich and that he is “a proud, unpleasant sort of man” (349). Elizabeth cries that she truly loves him and that her father does “not know what he really is” (349).Mr. Bennet says Darcy “is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask” (349). He is concerned that Elizabeth could not be happy “unless you truly [esteem] your husband” and that her “lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage” (349). Elizabeth finally convinces her father she loves Darcy, noting that his love “[has] stood the test of many months’ suspense” (350). Her father states, “I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy” (350).Elizabeth confesses Darcy’s role in Lydia’s marriage. Mr. Bennet is overjoyed: had his brother-in-law invested the money, he would have paid him back, but Darcy, madly in love, will refuse.That night, Elizabeth tells her mother about her engagement. After sitting silently in shock, Mrs. Bennet proclaims how delighted she is, how rich Elizabeth will be, and how “charming” and “handsome” she finds Darcy. Mrs. Bennet hopes Darcy “will overlook” (351) her previous dislike of him and says that this marriage dwarfs even Jane’s.Elizabeth fears how her mother will behave in front of Darcy. However, the next day, Mrs. Bennet, in her “awe” (352), says little. Mr. Bennet, who makes an effort to get to know Darcy and who likes him more and more, says Wickham is his favourite [sic] son-in-law but that he’ll like Bingley and Darcy equally.", "Volume 3, Chapter 18 Summary": "Darcy and Elizabeth discuss when he fell in love with her. Elizabeth asks if he “admire[d] me for my impertinence” (352); he says he admired her “[f]or the liveliness of your mind” (352). Elizabeth says he was “sick of civility” and “disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone” and that she “roused and interested you, because I was so unlike them” (353).She engages him in teasing banter about how he should “exaggerate” her “good qualities” and that she must “find occasions for teasing and quarrelling” (353) with him. She comments that “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use” (354). When Darcy says he will write to tell Lady Catherine right away, Elizabeth says she will sit by him “and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did” (354).Elizabeth writes to Mrs. Gardiner, thanking her for sharing what she knew about Darcy. She also thanks her for not going to the Lakes and says they “are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas” (355).Mr. Bennet writes a letter to Mr. Collins, telling him Darcy and Elizabeth are engaged, that he should “[c]onsole Lady Catherine,” but that in his shoes, he “would stand by the nephew,” who “has more to give” (355).Miss Bingley writes to Jane with “all her former professions of regard” (355). Jane, now knowing her character, feels “no reliance on her” but writes her “a much kinder answer than she [knows is] deserved” (355).Charlotte and Mr. Collins come to visit because Charlotte wants to be away from Lady Catherine, who is furious at the news. Elizabeth’s delight at seeing Charlotte is equaled only by her dismay at seeing Mr. Collins fawn over Darcy. However, Darcy tolerates it “with admirable calmness” (356).Mrs. Philips is “vulgar” (356) in her manners despite her awe of Darcy, and though Elizabeth is mortified, she feels his ability to bear it bodes well for the future. She’s excited for a time when they are away from everyone at Pemberley.", "Volume 3, Chapter 19 Summary": "Mrs. Bennet is thrilled the day she gets “rid of her two most deserving daughters” (357). The narrator wishes she could relate that Mrs. Bennet became “a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman” but notes Mr. Bennet “might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form” (357).Mr. Bennet misses Elizabeth and goes often to Pemberley. Jane and Bingley stay at Netherfield for a year before their close proximity to Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips taxes their patience. Bingley buys an estate near Derbyshire. Jane and Elizabeth live only thirty miles from each other.Kitty spends most of her time with Jane or Elizabeth, and “[i]n society so superior to what she had generally known […] her improvement [is] great” (357). Lydia frequently invites Kitty to visit, promising “balls and young men” (358), but Mr. Bennet refuses to let her go.Wickham and Lydia live above their means, and Lydia’s congratulatory letter to Elizabeth asks for financial help. Elizabeth does not mention it to Darcy but does send Lydia some of her own money occasionally. Lydia and Wickham constantly move around, looking for cheaper housing. Their affection for each other dwindles, his a little faster than hers.Darcy’s marriage devastates Miss Bingley, but she affects an air of civility in order to be allowed to continue visiting Pemberley.Georgiana Darcy lives at Pemberley, and she and Elizabeth love each other dearly. At first, Georgiana “listen[s] with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of talking to her brother” (359).Elizabeth teaches her “that a woman may take liberties with her husband” (359).Lady Catherine sends Darcy a letter so harsh as to make him stop speaking with her entirely until, at Elizabeth’s coaxing, he renews the relationship. Lady Catherine eventually receives them at Rosings, curious “to see how his wife conduct[s] herself” (360). Elizabeth receives Lady Catherine at Pemberley “in spite of that pollution which its woods had received” (360) from Elizabeth and the Gardiners.Darcy and Elizabeth love and cherish the Gardiners and are grateful they brought them together.", "Volume 3, Chapters 15-19 Analysis": "The final chapters of Pride and Prejudice compare different marriages and offer hope that women can, in fact, marry for love and be happy. Jane and Bingley, with their kindness, optimism, and amiability, have been established as a good match and finally become engaged. Quips Mr. Bennet, “You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income” (323). Elizabeth and Darcy, too, are well suited to each other. Elizabeth has finally come to realize he would be “softened” by “her ease and liveliness” and she would learn “from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world” (290). Just as Jane and Bingley agree to move away from Meryton, Elizabeth and Darcy work together to handle their delicate relationships with Wickham, Lydia, and Lady Catherine. The final paragraph of the book describes how both Darcy and Elizabeth love and respect the Gardiners, thus concluding with a reminder of how they are of similar minds.In contrast, Lydia and Wickham live a troubled, transient life, and their affection for each other quickly dwindles. The narrator notes that Mrs. Bennet doesn’t become more sensible and that perhaps Mr. Bennet prefers it this way. Mr. Bennet, however, begs Elizabeth to not let him “have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life” (350), suggesting he doesn’t want to see her suffer as he has. With so many examples of unhappy marriages, Mr. Bennet seeks to save her from the same fate.Importantly, Elizabeth achieves happiness by being herself, even though others in the novel—Lady Catherine, Mr. Collins, and even Mrs. Bennet—chastise her for her frankness and independence. Elizabeth’s intellect and honesty are what bring her and Darcy together, a fact reflected in Darcy’s second proposal when he says she is “too generous to trifle with me” and that she should tell him “at once” if she still dislikes him (340). In fact, Elizabeth’s frankness leads to Darcy having the courage to propose again in the first place, for he knows that had she “been absolutely, irrevocably” against marrying him, she would have told Lady Catherine “frankly and openly” (341).As previously established, Elizabeth and Darcy are similar not only in their frankness but also in their willingness to grow and to admit their flaws. Darcy speaks honestly of the change her criticisms wrought and how he was “properly humbled” (343) by them despite the fact that they “tortured” him. Elizabeth, too, is “heartily ashamed” (341) of her behavior and acknowledges their growth in her comment that the two of them are “widely different” (342) from what they were before. Elizabeth also shows growth when, in speaking with her father about her engagement to Darcy, she wishes her “former opinions had been more reasonable” (349) and expressed with more moderation.Elizabeth’s snide comment that “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use” (354) reflects the triumph of the deserving. Lady Catherine’s arrogance, though powerful over the likes of Mr. Collins, ultimately is weaker than integrity and love. The fact that Lady Catherine’s haughtiness brings about the exact conclusion she seeks to prevent suggests that those who look down on others do not accomplish the ends they seek."}}, "num_tokens": 166933}
