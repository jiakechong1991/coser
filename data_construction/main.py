Based on the provided book chunk, complete the following tasks:

1. Recognize chapter beginnings if they exist in the chunk. Identify the starting sentence of that chapter.
2. Identify the important plots in this chunk. Identify the beginning and ending of each plot by its first and last sentence. Determine the chapter title that the plot belongs to. Set "state" as "truncated" if the plot is truncated in this chunk, or "finished" otherwise. You will be provided with the truncated plots from the previous chunk, and you **must** extend the conversations with the current chunk while keeping the **scenario** unchanged. 
3. Summarize each important plot. For each plot, generate its summary, score its prominence from 1 to 100, and list the key characters and their roles, thoughts and actions in it.
4. Extract conversations for each plot. First, state the scenario and topic of the conversations. Then, list the key characters with their names, descriptions and thoughts (motivations) at this point. Finally, extract the conversations among them based on the following requirements: 
    i) Ensure the conversations are faithful to the plot and characters. They should be based on the original conversations in the text as much as possible. 
    ii) The conversations should be complete, covering the key dialogues and information. Each conversation should contain at least 10 utterances.
    iii) Each utterance should be composed of one or more thoughts, speech and actions. Use [] outside thoughts, like "[I feel fear and anger, but I cannot show it. I must remain calm and carefully handle his volatile temper.]", which others can't see. Use () outside actions, like "(silence)" or "(smiles at you)," which others can see. Always start an utterance with the character's thought. 
    iv) [IMPORTANT] When generating thoughts, you should think from the characters' perspectives, analyzing the internal thoughts behind their speech and actions in the original text. These thoughts should reflect aspects such as their personal background, personality, values, relationships with others, motivations, and goals. Each thought should be expressed as a phrase or sentence, rather than an adjective or adverb. 
    v) Additionally, describe environmental information (such as scenes, atmosphere, sudden events, etc.) of the conversations as an "utterance" where the "character" field is set as "Environment". The information should exclude characters' active thoughts, observations, and actions.
    vi) Keep the conversation in the same language as the chunk. 
5. Identify the optimal starting point for the subsequent chunk. If the last storyline has been extracted as an truncated plot, set next_chunk_start as None. Otherwise, set next_chunk_start as the first sentence of the last storyline.

2. [IMPORTANT] Ensure all DOUBLE QUOTES within all STRINGS are properly ESCAPED, especially when extracting from the text.
3. In the OUTPUT, use characters' full names, omitting any titles.
4. Maintain Story Fidelity: The plot must accurately reflect the book's content. Avoid introducing plots that are out of context. If the plot contains multiple conversations, prioritize the original dialogue from the book. In the absence of explicit conversations, create dialogue that aligns closely with the plot details.

Given a conversation from {book['title']}, enhance the scene setup and characters' motivations to create a comprehensive foundation for dramatic performance, i.e., to provide necessary background for actors to act out the conversation:

1. Review the provided conversation and contextual details thoroughly.
2. Expand the 'scenario' with rich situational context that actors need to convincingly perform the scene. Focus on essential background information, while excluding future details to be portrayed in the conversation.
3. Enhance each character's 'motivation' section with their complete mental and emotional state, including their feelings, ideas, objectives, topics they want to discuss, and information they want to convey. Align with their established character and role in the plot. 

===Output Format===
Please provide the output in the following JSON format:
{{
    "scenario": "A detailed scene-setting description that provides actors with essential context and atmosphere (< 200 words). Include all necessary background information while excluding future information to be revealed in the conversation.",
    "key_characters": [

        }}

===Requirements===
1. Adhere strictly to the specified output JSON format. 
2. [IMPORTANT] Ensure all DOUBLE QUOTES within all STRINGS are properly ESCAPED, especially when extracting from the text.
3. In the OUTPUT, keep the character names unchanged. 
4. Output in the same language as the input. 
5. Ensure the key_characters include exactly the same characters as the input, including {conv_key_characters}.
